The vendor of the Bluetooth module said that it\u2019s difficult to upgrade the scripts to Python 3. Therefore Python 2 is necessary to update the firmware of the Bluetooth module. We use the official installer package to install Python 2.7.18. In fact, you can install it yourself from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/.</p> <p>The default installed executable path is <code>/usr/local/bin/python</code>. The installed Python is for updating the firmware of Bluetooth module only. You can feel free to uninstall it after the update process is completed. To completely uninstall the installed Python 2.7, please execute the attached shell script. It will remove the files in \u201c/Applications/Python 2.7\u201d, \u201c/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework\u201d, and \u201c/usr/local/bin/py*\u201c.

This loop can pick up interference and generate audible noise, and is often influenced by the user's specific environment.With this understanding, we would like to suggest a few potential workarounds that may help resolve the issue:  </p> <ol> <li>Try using alternative audio or USB cables to connect your Spark amp to the external device. Some cables may be more prone to interference, and changing to a different cable may help alleviate the noise issue.</li> <li>If possible, switch the power sockets to which your Spark amp and the external device are connected. This may help eliminate any electrical interference that could be contributing to the noise.</li> </ol> <p>If neither of these suggestions resolves the issue, we recommend connecting your Spark amp to the external device via Bluetooth for audio playback as a workaround. This method should remove the ground loop factor and eliminate the noise.</p>"},{"location":"2.%20Troubleshooting/Product/Hardware/Spark%20Control/Bluetooth%20choppy%20audio%20when%20Spark%20Control%20is%20connected/","title":"Bluetooth choppy audio when Spark Control is connected","text":"<p>When Spark Control is connected, the Bluetooth gets cut off all the time / becomes choppy.
