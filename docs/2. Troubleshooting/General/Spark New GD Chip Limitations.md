# Spark New GD Chip Limitations
Beginning in late March, all Spark models (Spark 40, Spark MINI, Spark GO) will be updated with a **new GD chip for DSP processing** (with users receiving them approximately from May onwards). The reason for this change is due to sourcing and pricing issues. 

**It should be noted that minor variations may exist between individual chips.**

A known issue is that presets with higher CPU usage, such as specific effects or bass amps, can result in **slower preset switching**, and might even produce **cracking or popping noises**. This problem tends to occur more frequently when **all 7 pedals are activated simultaneously**.

To alleviate this issue, we recommend that customers deactivate any unnecessary pedals. Below are the effect module in Spark with higher CPU usage than the rest:

#### COMP
- Sustain Comp

#### DRIVE
- Bassmaster
- Tube Drive
- WAH

#### AMP
- Checkmate
- Two Stone SP50
- RB-800
- Sunny 3000

#### MOD
- Cloner Chorus
- Chorus
- Vibrato

#### DELAY
- Vintage Delay
- Reverse Delay

#### REVERB
(All the same)
