# Spark New GD Chip Limitations
## Internal Information

Beginning in late March 2023, all Spark models (Spark 40, Spark MINI, Spark GO) will be updated with a **new GD chip for DSP processing** (with users receiving them approximately from May onwards). The reason for this change is due to sourcing and pricing issues. 

**It should be noted that minor variations may exist between individual chips.**

A potential issue is that presets with higher CPU usage, such as specific effects or bass amps, can result in **slower preset switching**, and might even produce **crackling or popping noises**. This problem tends to occur more frequently when **all 7 pedals are activated simultaneously**.

**This is regarded as the product spec, and does NOT need to be fixed. We should only suggest workarounds with preset configuration (see below).**

## Troubleshooting Tips
If new customer (who receive their Spark after 2023/05) encounters mild crackling noise, please verify it's not **component related** (speaker rattling under high volume) nor **firmware/general hardware related** (factory reset + firmware update). 

If the crackling noise only happens with certain presets and also comes with slower switching speed, then it's likely due to this GD chip limitation. 

To alleviate this issue, we recommend that customers deactivate any unnecessary pedals, or swap out effects/amps with higher CPU usage. 

Below are the effect modules in Spark with higher CPU usage than the rest. These are the ones to avoid using when encountering the issue:

#### COMP
- Sustain Comp

#### DRIVE
- Bassmaster
- Tube Drive
- WAH

#### AMP
- Checkmate
- Two Stone SP50
- RB-800
- Sunny 3000

#### MOD
- Cloner Chorus
- Chorus
- Vibrato

#### DELAY
- Vintage Delay
- Reverse Delay

#### REVERB
