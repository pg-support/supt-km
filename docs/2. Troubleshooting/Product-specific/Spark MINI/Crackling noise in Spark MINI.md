# Crackling noise in Spark MINI
> There's speaker noise with higher volume.
> Speaker crackles when playing loud.

Ask the user to follow the steps below and provide the required information:

 1. Connect Spark MINI to Spark app
 2. Turn on Hi-Z mode
 3. Find the factory preset ‘Silver Ship’ under the Pop category
 4. Make sure your guitar volume and tone knobs are turned all the way up
 5. Play through the preset while turning up the Guitar knob on Spark MINI
 6. Please let us know at which knob position (ex: pass 12 o’clock) does the speaker starts clipping/crackling

Users might encounter speaker breakup noise if the volume is set too high, while using guitar tones that have more low end (bass frequency can cause speaker breakup more easily). In such cases, ask the customer to lower the overall volume and/or adjust the guitar tones to have less low end.

If the customer considers the crackling noise to be unusually apparent, ask for a video then escalate for further verification.
