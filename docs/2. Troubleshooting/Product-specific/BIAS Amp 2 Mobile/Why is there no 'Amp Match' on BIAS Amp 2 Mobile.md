# Why is there no 'Amp Match' on BIAS Amp 2 Mobile
> I cannot find the 'Amp Match' block/option in BIAS Amp 2 Mobile

There is no 'Amp Match' functionality in BIAS Amp 2 Mobile, you'll need to use the desktop version to perform the 'Amp Match' process.

However, you can still use presets with 'Amp Match' built-in on BIAS Amp 2 Mobile.
