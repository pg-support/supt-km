# BIAS FX 2 crashes / freezes at startup (Standalone / Plug-in)
### **Narrow down the issue**

-   Was the program running normally before? Was the system or the program updated, or was there any new program installed, before the issue occurs?

-   Does disabling the cloud service (Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, etc) resolve the issue? 

-   [Backup the presets](https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/218315863-How-to-Backup-My-Presets-) and try reinstalling the program. Does it help?

-   Can the same issue be reproduced on another computer?

### If the issue persists, ask the user to provide the following information

-   Version of BIAS FX 2  

*Make sure both standalone and plugin are both up-to-date and at the same version   

-   OS (Mac / Windows) and the OS version

-   Happening to both Standalone and plug-in versions, or only one of them?

	-   If only plug-in is having the issue, what DAW is the user using? 
	  
	-   Does the issue persist in another DAW? (We often recommend testing out [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) because it’s free, available on both platforms, and can run various plug-in formats (AU, VST2, VST3).)
