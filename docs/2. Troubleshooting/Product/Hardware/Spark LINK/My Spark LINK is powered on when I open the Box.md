# My Spark LINK is powered on when I open the Box

Due to the slim package, Spark LINK TX & RX might be powered on if squeezed accidentally by other packages during transit.

Rest assured that all Spark LINK units are brand new. We recommend fully charging Spark LINK with the cable inside the package before your first usage.

#### **Internal Information** 
The existing packaging design poses a risk of inadvertent product activation during backend transportation. The updated design to address this issue will be implemented after the production of 10,000 units.
