### **Internal Information** 

## 240704 Updated:
##### Spark LINK with USB C to C (After May 2024)

The product team decided to change the cable spec from 'USB-A to 2 x USB-C' to 'USB-C to 2 x USB-C'. They also modified the PCB to ensure that Spark LINK can be charged with a fast charge (PD) adapter.

*Note: Spark LINK doesn't support fast charging; it will only convert the current and use it for regular charging.*



##### Spark LINK with USB A to C (Before May 2024)

If the customer asks whether Spark LINK works with a USB-C to C cable, we'll inform them that it does not support this type of cable and recommend using the included USB-A to USB-C cable for charging.

The provided Y cables are USB-C x 2 to USB-A and it is required to use our supplied cable for product charging and firmware updates. 

Consumers can utilize commercially available C to A cables for charging; ~~however, firmware updates require the use of our provided cable~~. Additionally, the product currently does not support any USB-C to C PD Charger.

**In other words, while most USB C to C cables support USB-PD (power delivery, aka 快充), it's important to note that Spark LINK does not support USB-PD. 
Consequently, it's impossible to charge Spark LINK using a USB C to C cable.
