# Crackling interference

- The crackling interference noise may be caused by environmental signal interference.


Suggestions:

- Try repairing the Spark LINK (While both powered on, double-press the button on Spark Link TX to scan and re-pair to Spark Link RX. )
  
- Stay 2 meters (6 feet) away from any WIFI router or computer to avoid interference.
  
- If you have guitar wireless system from another brand, please turn it off and then restart Spark LINK.
  
- If possible, please also collect information about the user's other wireless system models.
