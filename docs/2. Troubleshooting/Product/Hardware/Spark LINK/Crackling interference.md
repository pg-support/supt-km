# Crackling interference

- The crackling interference noise may be caused by environmental signal interference.


Troubleshooting:

1. Power off both the Spark LINK TX and RX units. Then, power on the Spark LINK TX unit first, followed by the RX unit.

2. Try repairing the Spark LINK (While both powered on, double-press the button on Spark LINK TX to scan and re-pair to Spark LINK RX.)


Suggestions:

- Stay 2 meters (6 feet) away from any WI-FI router, Bluetooth device, or computer to avoid interference.

- If you have guitar wireless system from another brand, please turn it off and then restart Spark LINK.
  
- If possible, please also collect information about the user's other wireless system models.
