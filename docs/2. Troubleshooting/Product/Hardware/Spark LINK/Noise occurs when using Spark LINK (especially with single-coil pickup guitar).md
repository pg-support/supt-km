# Noise occurs when using Spark LINK (especially with single-coil pickup guitar)

The noise you hear from the amp might be caused by the pickups themselves (especially with [single-coil pickups](https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/single-coil-pickup-noise/)).

The reason you don't experience the same noise when using a regular instrument cable is because a physical cable often comes with a higher capacitance.

On the other hand, an instrument cable may have some slight signal loss, but Spark LINK restores the signal to a loss-free state. Consequently, noise from the guitar may be slightly amplified.

To reduce the noise from the single-coil pickup, consider increasing the threshold on the noise gate pedal.
