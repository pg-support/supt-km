# Temperature warning
> Spark MINI gets hot during playing/charging. Is it normal?
> Spark MINI shows the full red LED blinking / temperature warning, but the temperature is totally normal and does not get hot at all.

Spark MINI is capable of working under the environment between 32°F~127.4°F / 0°~53° C. If Spark MINI is reaching the limit of the temperature range, the status indicators will start to show red colors and blink quickly to warn it is close to temperature limitation. If the situation is not improved, Spark MINI will be shut down temporarily, and it will be able to turn on when the temperature is back to normal again.

If the issue persists with no apparent raise in the temperature, check with the customer’s **playing time and volume setting.** Escalate to Dans for further verification with the product team.
