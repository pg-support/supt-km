# I can't save my customized scenario to Spark Control X

Currently customers are unable to save the customized scenarios to the Spark Control X when it's connected to the Spark LIVE.

However, when the Spark Control X is connected to the Spark 40/MINI/GO via the Spark app, the customized scenarios can be saved to the Spark Control X.

### Internal Information
Currently the customer can't save the "up to 8 scenarios" Positive Grid claimed before the product is released.

When Spark Control is connected to the Spark LIVE, the scenario will only display 2 default scenarios.

This issue will be fixed via app update & Spark LIVE/Control X firmware update (ETA end of July, 24)
