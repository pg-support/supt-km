# My Spark LIVE will not connect to the Spark Control X automatically after powering on and off

Rest assured, it is normal behavior for the Spark LIVE not to connect to the Spark Control X automatically after being powered on and off. 

The customer needs to reconnect the Spark LIVE and Spark Control X by pressing the pair button on the rear of the Spark LIVE.

The only exception is if there is an unexpected disconnection (within 1 minute), such as power loss or being out of acceptable connection distance.
