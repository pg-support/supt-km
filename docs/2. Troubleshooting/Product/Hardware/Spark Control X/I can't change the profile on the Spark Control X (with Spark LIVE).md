# I can't change the profile on the Spark Control X (with Spark LIVE)

Currently, customers are unable to change the profile/customize the scenarios for the Spark Control X when it's connected to the Spark LIVE.

This feature is only available for Spark Control X when it's connected to Spark 40/MINI/GO, which require the Spark app to use the Spark Control X.

---
### Internal Information
Currently, the Spark Control X doesn't have the "save up to 8 scenarios" feature that Positive Grid claimed before the product was released.

When the Spark Control X is connected to the Spark LIVE, there are only 2 default scenarios.

This issue will be fixed via app update & Spark LIVE/Control X firmware update (ETA end of July, 24)
