# Spark Control Charging Troubleshooting

> Troubleshooting for users claiming their Spark Control cannot charge

1. Ensure that the Red Power LED does not illuminate when the cable is connected to a charging brick.
2. If the LED illuminate normally but still cannot charge, initiate a replacement.
3. If the LED doesn't illuminate normally, request the user to provide a photo of the cable. Specifically, we need to check if the cable has a longer USB-A tip.

4. If it is confirmed that the wrong cable is being used, follow the Service Part Request process: [[Service part request (US) - Check Basecamp for updates]] or [[Service part request (Non-US) - Check Basecamp for updates]].
   
5. In the event that the correct cable is being used but the issue persists, initiate a replacement of the entire unit through the RMA process.
