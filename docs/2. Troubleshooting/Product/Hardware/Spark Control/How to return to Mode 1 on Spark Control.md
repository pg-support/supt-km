# How to return to Mode 1 on Spark Control
- Hold the mode button on Spark Control, and release as soon as you see the red LED blink once (the number of blinking indicates which mode it’s in).
- Spark app also will warn the user that they’re currently not in Mode 1, thus cannot properly use Spark Control with Spark, and will instruct the user how to get back to Mode 1.
