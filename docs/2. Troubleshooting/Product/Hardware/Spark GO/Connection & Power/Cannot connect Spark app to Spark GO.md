# Cannot connect Spark app to Spark GO

If you experience any connectivity issues after connecting for the first time, first try to go into Pairing Mode by clicking the power button on the side of the Spark GO **(while the unit is powered on)** and try to reconnect.

Reboot the Spark GO and enter Pairing Mode then try to reconnect again.

Close the Spark app by swiping it away from your smartphone's multitasking menu. Next, power on the Spark GO and enter Pairing Mode. Then, attempt to reconnect it to the Spark app.
