# Noise when using Fuzz Face (pedal) - Check Basecamp for updates

The sound changes when using Spark LINK with a Fuzz Face pedal due to impedance mismatch.

The Fuzz Face pedal requires a high impedance passive input, and when connected directly to the guitar with a physical cable, the pickups become an integral part of the circuit.

Spark LINK, as a wireless system comes with a lower impedance which restores the signal to a loss-free state. 




--- Under Construction---
When using the Fuzz Face, it's best suited for direct connection to the guitar and not for connection to a wireless system or placed after other effects pedals. 

A wireless system acts as a buffer pedal, which is why the Fuzz Face is often positioned as the first pedal in the effects chain on pedalboards.
