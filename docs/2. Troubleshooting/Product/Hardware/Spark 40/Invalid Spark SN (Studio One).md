# Invalid Spark SN (Studio One)
> I want to register my Spark but it shows the SN is invalid.

1. Verify the user’s Spark amp purchase or get a photo of their Spark’s SN before registering the SN for the user.
2. Use PGBot (see [[PGBot Commands]]) to manually register the SN for the user. Then ask the user to try registering again.
