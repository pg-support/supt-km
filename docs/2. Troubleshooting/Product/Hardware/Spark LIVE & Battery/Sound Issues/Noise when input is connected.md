# Noise when input is connected

Symptom: The noise floor increases when the input is connected. (From either Input 1~4, Bluetooth Audio, or USB) 


Solution: Provide the information

What you’re hearing comes from the power amp. Under normal circumstances, to ensure the best user experience, the power amp is automatically muted when there are no inputs to the Spark LIVE. When the Spark LIVE detects input, either from the input jack or via Bluetooth, the power amp will be unmuted. That’s what you hear from Spark LIVE when Bluetooth audio/USB is connected.
