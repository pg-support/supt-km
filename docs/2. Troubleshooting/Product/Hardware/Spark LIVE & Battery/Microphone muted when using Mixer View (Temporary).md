# Microphone muted when using Mixer View (Temporary)

When adjusting Channel 2 in the Mixer View within the Spark app, the microphone mutes if it's plugged into Channel 2 via the XLR.

Workaround: disconnect the microphone and plug it into Ch. 2 again.

**The product team is aware of this issue, and it should be fixed in the recent update of the Spark app.**
