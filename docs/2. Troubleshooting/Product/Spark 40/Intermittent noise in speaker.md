# Intermittent noise in speaker
> Sometimes there’s this noise in my Spark.
> Speaker rattles/crackles when playing.
> There's a popping noise with Spark.

- Verify if it’s the speaker rattle with certain frequency/volume -> RMA
- Verify if it’s the popping noise when the amp is turned on/off -> RMA


==- Special Case:==

If the amp is out-of-warranty and there is a popping noise when the amp is powered on/off, please ask the customer to provide a clear photo of the serial number.

Check if the 7th digit is 9 or 0:
S040C5**9A**xxxxx, S040C9**02**xxxxx, and S040C9**0C**xxxxx

*It means the amp was manufactured in 2019 & 2020*

In this case, we'll assist the customer to return/exchange the amp (PG paid).
