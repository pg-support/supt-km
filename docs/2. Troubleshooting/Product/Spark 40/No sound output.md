# No sound output
> There’s no sound coming out of my Spark

Verify if only guitar sound is gone, or audio playback (Bluetooth/USB/Aux In) is also gone

-   No sound output in all outputs -> RMA
  
-   Only guitar sound is gone, verify if the guitar/guitar cable is working properly. If issue persists -> RMA
  
-   Only audio playback is gone, verify which one is gone. Troubleshoot the output that has no output: Check connection, make sure it’s not blocked by other connections.

  
  
  
- Special Case:

If the amp is out-of-warranty, please ask the customer to provide a clear photo of the serial number.

Check if the 7th digit is 9 or 0:
S040C5**9A**xxxxx, S040C9**02**xxxxx, and S040C9**0C**xxxxx
 ***It means the amp was manufactured in 2019 & 2020*
