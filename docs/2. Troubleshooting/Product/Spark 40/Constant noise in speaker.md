> I’m hearing constant hum/hiss/white/fuzz/crackling noise in my Spark

- Verify if PSU is grounded -> If not, resend grounded PSU ([[Regular PSU requests]])
- If PSU is grounded, the noise is the white noise caused by defective component (video is helpful) -> RMA 


==- Special Case:==

If the amp is out-of-warranty and there is no guitar sound from the main out, only white noise, please ask the customer to provide a clear photo of the serial number.

Check if the 7th digit is 9 or 0:
S040C5**9A**xxxxx, S040C9**02**xxxxx, and S040C9**0C**xxxxx

*It means the amp was manufactured in 2019 & 2020*

In this case, we'll assist the customer to return/exchange the amp (PG paid).


~~Inform the customer:~~

~~This issue has been identified in some of the previous models of the Spark amp that were manufactured during a specific period.~~ 

~~*Please note that not all Spark users experience this issue.~~
