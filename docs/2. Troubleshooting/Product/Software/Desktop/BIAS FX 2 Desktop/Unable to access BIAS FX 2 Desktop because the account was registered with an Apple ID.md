# Unable to access BIAS FX 2 Desktop because the account was registered with an Apple ID

> "I registered the Positive Grid account with my Apple ID, but there is no Apple ID login option in BIAS FX 2 Desktop."

When a customer registers a Positive Grid account using the 'Login with Apple' option, our system automatically considers the private relay email generated by Apple as the customer's email.

## 1. Explain to the customer and ask for the private relay email.

Let the customer understand that BIAS FX 2 currently doesn't support "Login with Apple". 

Advise the customer to sign up for a Positive Grid account using their regular email address.

Once the customer has created a new account, request both their new Positive Grid account email and the private relay email associated with it.

The private relay email can be found under 'Email' on the 'My Account' page when logging in with Apple ID.

Transfer the license for BIAS FX 2 Desktop to the customer's new Positive Grid account. [END]

*Do NOT transfer the BIAS FX 2 Mobile since the customer might still want to use "Login with Apple" feature in BIAS FX 2 Mobile.*
