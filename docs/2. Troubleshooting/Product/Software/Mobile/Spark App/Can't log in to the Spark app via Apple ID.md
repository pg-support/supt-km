# Can't log in to the Spark app via Apple ID

Symptom: Customers can't log into the Spark using the "Sign in with Apple ID" option.


Workaround:

1. Backup the presets via Dropbox (Optional, but strongly recommended).
   If the customer has installed BIAS FX 2 Mobile on the same device, please also ask them to backup BIAS FX 2 Mobile.
   
2. Log out of the Spark app .
   
3. Navigate o to Settings on the phone -> [Your Name] (Apple ID) -> Sign-In & Security -> Sign in with Apple.
   這裡顯示是BIAS FX 2沒錯, Spark app在這邊沒有選項
   
4. Tap "Edit" in the top-right corner and delete "BIAS FX 2". 
   
5. Launch the Spark app and log in using the "Sign in with Apple ID" option.
