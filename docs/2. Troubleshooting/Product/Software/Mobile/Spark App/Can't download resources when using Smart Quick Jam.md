# Can't download resources when using Smart/Quick Jam

**Symptom:** 
When I click on Quick/Smart Jam, a "Download Resources" window appears. However, when I click "Download," nothing happens.**

1. Close Spark app.  
2. Go to Settings -> Apps -> Google Play Store -> Permissions -> Notifications -> Allow notifications
