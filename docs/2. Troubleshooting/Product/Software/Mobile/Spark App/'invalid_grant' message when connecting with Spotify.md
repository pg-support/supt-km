If users sees 'invalid_grant' message when trying to connect to Spotify (clicking on the Spotify icon in the Spark app menu), please ask the user to go to [their Spotify's setting page](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/apps/) > Apps, and check if 'Energy' is granted access. 

Alternatively, they may try uninstalling and reinstalling Spark app and try connecting to Spotify again.
