# Spark GO Bricked or No Sound after Firmware Update

Collect the following info and get back to Dans:

1.  Verify if Spark GO can still be turned on
   
2.  When Spark GO is on, do the 4 preset LEDs blink simultaneously, or do they appear to be normal (1 LED light up at a time)?
   
3.  When Spark GO is on, is it still possible to switch the presets (and see the preset LEDs reacting)?
   
4.  Is it possible to connect to Spark app via Bluetooth?
   
5.  What's the computer OS (Win/Mac) used for the firmware update?  
   
6.  Additionally, please use Zendesk macro [Spark GO::Firmware Update Log] to offer the log tool for further troubleshooting and see if the issue persists.
