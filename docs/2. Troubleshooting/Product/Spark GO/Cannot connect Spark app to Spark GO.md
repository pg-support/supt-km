# Cannot connect Spark app to Spark GO

If you experience any connectivity issues after connecting for the first time, first try to go into Pairing Mode by clicking the power button on the side of the Spark GO **(while the unit is powered on)** and try to reconnect.

Reboot the Spark GO and enter Pairing Mode then try to reconnect again.

Try closing the Spark app by removing it from the multitasking menu of your smartphone. Open the Spark GO again and try reconnecting once youâ€™ve turned on the Spark GO and have entered Pairing Mode.
