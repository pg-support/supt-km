## Scratched on the Display

The scratches on the RIFF display screen are only on the protective plastic film. Please ask the customers to remove the plastic film:

Please remove the plastic film on the display screen and see if it's acceptable for you.

If not, please do let me know. I'll be happy to help you return the RIFF to our service center and rearrange a replacement for you.
