# Spark Control Charging Troubleshooting

> Troubleshooting for users claiming their Spark Control cannot charge

1. Ensure that the Red Power LED does not illuminate when the cable is connected to a charging brick.
2. If the LED illuminate normally but still cannot charge, initiate a replacement.
3. If the LED doesn't illuminate normally, request the user to provide a photo of the cable. Specifically, we need to check if the cable has a longer USB-A tip.
