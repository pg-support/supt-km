> When Spark Control is connected, the Bluetooth gets cut off all the time / becomes choppy. It's the same from Spark app or from other music app like Spotify, etc. It becomes normal once Spark Control is disconnected.

Below are the details for the issue. Use it as reference for reply.

- Certain iOS devices will encounter choppy Bluetooth playback when Spark Control is connected, however this only happens to a very little number of devices and we cannot be 100% certain that certain iOS + iPhone/iPad combinations will always produce this issue.

Solution:
  
  1. Back up the presets on the Spark amp, and perform a factory reset [[How to factory reset Spark 40]].
  2. Connect Spark Control, then open AirTurn (manager) app.
  3. Find the connected device (Spark Control should start with SKC50S...) and click on it.
  4. Go to 'Advanced' setting and change the connection speed to 'Low power mode'. 
  5. Tap "Save" on the top-right corner.

This should resolve the issue.
