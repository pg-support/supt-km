# No sound output
> There’s no sound coming out of my Spark

Verify if only guitar sound is gone, or audio playback (Bluetooth/USB/Aux In) is also gone
-   No sound output in all outputs -> RMA
-   Only guitar sound is gone, verify if the guitar/guitar cable is working properly. If issue persists -> RMA
-   Only audio playback is gone, verify which one is gone. Troubleshoot the output that has no output: Check connection, make sure it’s not blocked by other connections.
