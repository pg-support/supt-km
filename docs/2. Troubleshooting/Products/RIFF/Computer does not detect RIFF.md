# Computer does not detect RIFF
-   For Windows, make sure the [latest audio driver](https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/4498157897229) is installed.
-   Make sure the OS is supported by RIFF. (Check [system requirements](https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405522299021-RIFF-Tech-Spec-Compatibility))
-   Connect RIFF directly to the computer with the included USB cable (verify if the USB cable is functional) or change to another USB cable (avoid using USB hub or adapter).
- Change USB Root Hub settings & USB Selective Suspended settings ([instruction](https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405943006733-RIFF-USB-Device-Not-Recognized-in-Windows))
