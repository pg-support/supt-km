# RIFF has high noise floor or hiss noise when playing
> RIFF might emit a (gated) hiss noise when playing, which will be more apparent when playing with high gain presets.

RIFF might have a slightly higher noise floor for some users, and it also has a built-in noise gate to help control the noise floor.

For users concerned about the noise floor issue, simply let them know that their RIFF is not defective and this is just a normal situation with RIFF. 

Any further complaint should be escalated for discussion.
