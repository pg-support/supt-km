# Auto-gain says the input is low
> “When I click on auto-gain, it says the input is too low thus the auto-gain cannot work.” - Auto-gain feature doesn’t work

-   Verify if the rest of the RIFF’s function is normal (can be properly detected by BIAS FX 2, shows input and output meter, etc).     
-   If RIFF is not properly detected by BIAS FX 2, proceed by troubleshooting the audio setting and USB connection ([Computer does not detect RIFF](Computer%20does%20not%20detect%20RIFF.md)).
-   If BIAS FX 2 plays fine with RIFF, only that the Auto Gain function has no response, proceed with the following:
	- Rename the BIAS_FX2 folder in Documents/PositiveGrid to "BIAS_FX2 backup"
	- Relaunch BIAS FX 2 and try Auto Gain again.
