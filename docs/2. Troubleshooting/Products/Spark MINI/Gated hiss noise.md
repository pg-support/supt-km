# Gated hiss noise
> There's this gated hiss noise whenever I'm playing, especially when playing the lower strings/bass.

A component in Spark MINI might cause higher noise floor with certain amp/effect settings. The amp will produce a short burst of hiss noise (in the background) when playing a guitar or bass (especially bass). The noise is more apparent when playing lower notes and with presets that have more treble.
