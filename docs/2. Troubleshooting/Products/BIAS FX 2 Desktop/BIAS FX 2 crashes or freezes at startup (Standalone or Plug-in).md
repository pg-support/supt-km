# BIAS FX 2 crashes / freezes at startup (Standalone / Plug-in)
Ask the user to provide the following information
-   Version of BIAS FX 2  
*Make sure both standalone and plugin are both up-to-date and at the same version   
-   OS (Mac / Windows) and the OS version
-   Happening to both Standalone and plug-in versions, or only one of them?
	-   If only plug-in is having the issue, what DAW is the user using? 
	-   Does the issue persist in another DAW? (We often recommend testing out [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) because it’s free, available on both platforms, and can run various plug-in formats (AU, VST2, VST3).)
-   Was the program running normally before? Was the system or the program updated, or was there any new program installed, before the issue occurs?
-   Does disabling the cloud service (Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, etc) resolve the issue? 
-   If issue persists, ask the user collect the crash log for us to further verify:
