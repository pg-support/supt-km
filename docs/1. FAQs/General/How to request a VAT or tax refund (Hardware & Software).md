# How to request a VAT or tax refund (Hardware & Software)

> Info regarding VAT charges and refunds based on the country of purchase.

VAT is charged for several regions, and the setup is based on a per Shopify store basis (it cannot be set up for each country individually).

~~Positive Grid currently only has tax ID numbers for specific countries. As a result, we can only provide VAT invoices to customers from these selected countries who wish to request a VAT refund from their local government.~~ 

Please ask for the company's **VAT number** and **business address** from the customer and verify it with the following site:
[Check the VAT number](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation)

If the VAT number is valid, send the following information and tag Maines/WeiTing on Supt-Private channel to create an invoice with VAT#:

- VAT#
  
- Billing Address (should be a company address)

## Offer a VAT Invoice with a Corresponding Tax Rate

Customers from **Germany**, **the UK**, and **Australia** with a valid VAT number and business address, who request a VAT invoice, will receive a comprehensive invoice from Shopify with all necessary details, including the corresponding VAT number.

For customers who do NOT have a valid VAT number & business address who request a VAT invoice, we can issue a VAT invoice listing the tax (based on the country). 

If the order doesn't include tax & tax rate, please refer to the [VAT tax rate form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ff020CG0y80BugqOhEu_gE3a7jkCHxFLIG1wkUZaHX8/edit#gid=0).


Do NOT issue a VAT refund for these cases.

## Offer a VAT Invoice with a 0% Tax Rate

Customers from countries in the EU (other than Germany) with a valid VAT number & business address, who request a VAT invoice, will receive an invoice with a 0% tax rate.

We'll also issue a partial refund directly as a VAT refund on Spotify later (depending on the tax being charged on Shopify).
