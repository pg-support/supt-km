# How to request a VAT or tax refund (Hardware & Software)

> We can create the invoice w/wo VAT for orders on Shopify & Amazon.

VAT is applied to several regions, and the configuration is established on a per Shopify store basis. Due to variations in the tax rate for each country, it cannot be set up individually for each country."

~~Positive Grid currently only has tax ID numbers for specific countries. As a result, we can only provide VAT invoices to customers from these selected countries who wish to request a VAT refund from their local government.~~ 

To request an invoice with a VAT number, customers are required to provide both a valid VAT number and a business address. 

The agent can verify the VAT number with the following site:
[Check the VAT number](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation)

Once the validity of the VAT number is confirmed, send the following information and tag WeiTing/Heyling on Supt-Private channel to create an invoice with VAT number:

- Order#
  
- VAT#
  
- Billing Address (should be a company address)




The shipping address and information must match the original order on Shopify.
The billing address can be adjusted without any issues.

訂購人姓名和shipping address必須跟原訂單相同
billing address可以調整沒關係
