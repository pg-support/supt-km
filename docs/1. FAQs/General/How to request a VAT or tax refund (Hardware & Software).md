# How to request a VAT or tax refund (Hardware & Software)

> Info regarding VAT charges and refunds based on the country of purchase.

VAT is charged for several regions, and the setup is based on a per Shopify store basis (it cannot be set up for each country individually).

~~Positive Grid currently only has tax ID numbers for specific countries. As a result, we can only provide VAT invoices to customers from these selected countries who wish to request a VAT refund from their local government.~~ 

Please ask for the company's **VAT number** and **address** from the customer and verify it with the following site:

If the VAT number is valid, send the following information and ask Maines/WeiTing to create an invoice with VAT#:

- Order#
  
- VAT#
  
- Billing Address (should be a company address)

## Direct VAT Refunds

**This policy is applicable to all EU countries except Germany (DE).**

For countries in the EU, we will directly refund the VAT to the customer without offering a VAT invoice (Tax % depends on the order page).

For example, Order#EU-24504 has 20% tax, we will issue a partial refund â‚¬19.84 as tax return.

Please leave the refund reason as "VAT return - VAT No.", for example, "VAT return - FR79894580356". 

Refer to the [[Refund Process]] for further details.


## Offer a VAT Invoice

We provide a VAT invoice (tax rate 19%) with all the details from Shopify for customers in Germany (or those with a DE VAT number).
