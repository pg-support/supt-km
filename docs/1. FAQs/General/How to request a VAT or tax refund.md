# How to request a VAT or tax refund

> Info regarding VAT charges and refunds based on the country of purchase.

VAT is charged for several regions, and the setup is based on a per Shopify store basis (it cannot be set up for each country individually).

Positive Grid currently only has tax ID numbers for specific countries. As a result, we can only provide VAT invoices to customers from these selected countries who wish to request a VAT refund from their local government.
