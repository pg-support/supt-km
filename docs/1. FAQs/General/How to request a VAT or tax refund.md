# How to request a VAT or tax refund

> Info regarding VAT charges and refunds based on the country of purchase.

VAT is charged for several regions, and the setup is based on a per Shopify store basis (it cannot be set up for each country individually).

Positive Grid currently only has tax ID numbers for specific countries. As a result, we can only provide VAT invoices to customers from these selected countries who wish to request a VAT refund from their local government. 

## Offer VAT Invoice

For the countries listed below, we can offer a VAT invoice, which allows customers to request a VAT refund from their local government. 

- Canada
- EU: France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain
- United States

Contact Maines/WeiTing to create the VAT invoice.

## Direct VAT Refunds

For countries where Positive Grid doesn't have a tax ID number but still charge VAT during checkout, we will directly refund the VAT to the customer without the need for a VAT invoice. This applies to the following countries:

- All EU countries except France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain
- United Kingdom

Please manually put in the refund amount during the refund process. Check [[Refund Process]] for further details.

## No VAT Concerns

For countries such as Australia (AU) and Japan (JP) where we don't charge VAT during checkout, there are no related concerns.
