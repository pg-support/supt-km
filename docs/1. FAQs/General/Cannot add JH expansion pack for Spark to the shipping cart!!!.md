OST team has updated the behavior when adding Experience Jimi Hendrix™ for Spark to the cart and modified wording on the PDP of Experience Jimi Hendrix™.

When the customer add Experience Jimi Hendrix™ for Spark to the cart, it will also automatically add a Spark (40) to the cart.

If the customer purchased the Spark series on Positive Grid's official website recently, we can create an order for Experience Jimi Hendrix™ for Spark on Shopify.
