I sincerely apologize for the confusing information and I will forward your experience to our marketing team.

If you purchased the Spark amp from Positive Grid’s retailers, such as Guitar Center or Amazon, I’m sorry to inform you that this add-on purchase does not apply to your order.  
  
However, if you purchased the Spark amp directly from Positive Grid's official website, please reply to this email with your order number. This will allow me to assist you further.
