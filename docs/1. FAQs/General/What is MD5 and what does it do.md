# What is MD5 and what does it do
MD5 is basically the 'ID' of each software installer that's available on our website. Every time we release a new update, we'll also renew the installer's MD5 number in our user center (right at where you select the download options), so the user may verify if they downloaded the correct official file from Positive Grid.

To answer user's question, inform them that MD5 is a tool that helps to make sure their downloaded installer is exactly the same as what we built. If the user intends to verify the MD5 of their installer, they can follow the steps provided in the link below:
