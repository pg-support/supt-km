# How to change the user's account email
In order to change one's login email, the user must first create a new account and then request that we migrate the old one. 

It's important to note that this action will only move software licenses to the new account and will not transfer the purchase record. The purchase records will still be associated with the email used to place the order for the sake of maintaining data integrity and security.
