# Product availability and shipping delays for orders through authorized dealers.

From Robert:  
Itâ€™s not a matter of whether dealers are allowed to offer our products during a pre-launch period. We cannot tell a dealer when they can sell one of our products. I know that we did not ship the Canada distributor LIVE orders on time so getting inventory to dealers in Canada is a bit delayed. I suggest telling the customer this:

We are unable to provide a shipping date for a purchase made with one of our authorized dealers. Please check with your Positive Grid dealer for updates on when your order will arrive. **{Product_Name}** is an amazing product that is receiving great reviews from all over the world. We hope you enjoy your **{Product_Name}** when it arrives. Thank you for your support of Positive Grid.
