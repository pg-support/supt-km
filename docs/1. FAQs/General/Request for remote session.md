# Request for remote session
If a user is asking us to access their computer for a remote session to fix a problem, we need to inform that we currently do not offer remote services for safety and privacy reasons. Instead, kindly ask the user to follow the instructions provided for troubleshooting.

However, in special cases where our product team needs to investigate an issue in the user's environment, we may proactively reach out for a remote session. Such cases will be initiated by Dans in association with the product team.
