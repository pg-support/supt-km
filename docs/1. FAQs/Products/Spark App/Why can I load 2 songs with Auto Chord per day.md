# Why can I load 2 songs with Auto Chord per day
Auto Chord feature is mainly opened to users with Spark amps.

If Spark app is not connected to Spark amp for more than 15 days, Auto Chord will be locked and limited to 2 songs per day.

Users will have to (1) connect the app to Spark amp to unlock, or (2) fill in Spark order number and order email to unlock the feature (only available before the amp is delivered).
