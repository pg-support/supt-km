# Do I have to buy the presets in Spark
No. Not only are there factory presets built into the amp, there are a lot more presets you can find in the accompanying Spark app. Furthermore, you can find thousands more presets free of charge when you log into Spark’s ToneCloud. Please refer to [this link](https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/8141133570701-Download-Upload-Presets-with-ToneCloud) to learn more about ToneCloud.

Additionally, you may purchase the expansion pack(s) for Spark to enjoy more amp/effect options, which will grant you access to more presets.
