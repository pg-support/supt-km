# Why is there an age restriction for downloading?

Since the 17+ restriction prevents minors from downloading or using the Spark app, many parents will inquire about the reason for the age restriction.

We can answer this question with the following:

---

As users can now watch YouTube videos in the Spark app, it’s essential to note that certain music videos may contain offensive, violent, or unsuitable content for minors. Consequently, our product team has set the age rating to 17+.

For more information:  
Apps in 17+ may also contain frequent and intense offensive language; frequent and intense cartoon, fantasy or realistic violence; and frequent and intense mature, horror and suggestive themes; plus sexual content, nudity, alcohol, tobacco and drugs which may not be suitable for children under the age of 17.

FYI:
The age restrictions for the Spark app are related to YouTube's policy and vary across different platforms: 

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service; however, children of all ages may use the Service and YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.

However, the age restrictions on Android Google Play is 3+, while on the Apple App Sotre, it's 17+.
