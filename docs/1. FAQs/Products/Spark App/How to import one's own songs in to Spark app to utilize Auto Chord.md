# How to import one's own songs in to Spark app to utilize Auto Chord
Unfortunately it's not currently possible to import user files into Spark app due to copyright restriction.

As long as the songs are not uploaded to YouTube, Spark app will not be able to find them in order to show the chords.

> I donâ€™t have Spotify / Apple Music, can I import my own music into Spark app for Auto Chord?

If you do not use Apple Music and Spotify, we'd encourage you manually search for the songs in Spark app's music page with the built-in YouTube engine.
