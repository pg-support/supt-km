# Why doesn't Spark app support Android 7 anymore
> Does Spark app still support Android 7?

- [Android 7 is no longer supported by Google since October 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Nougat#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202022%2C%204.02,security%20updates%20after%20October%202019). 

- To ensure the stability of Spark app on Android in the future, we have also stopped supporting Android 7 since 2022. 

- For existing users (NOT new users) who'd like to continue using Spark app on their Android 7 devices, we may provide them with the final version of the [Spark app apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tCpsSictGmQe6KSBQgZb8ZC2hTaLb3EP/view?usp=sharing) that can be used on Android 7. 

- Please inform the user not to further update the Spark app after installation. And they need to understand that with Android 7 devices, they will not be able to take advantage of any new features added with later updates. If they wish to use new features, they will need to use a newer device with at least Android 8.1 or above.

- We'll also not be able to provide any assistance regarding app or compatibility issues on the old version of Spark app, given the aforementioned circumstances.
