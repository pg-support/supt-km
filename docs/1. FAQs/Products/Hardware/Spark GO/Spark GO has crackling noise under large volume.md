# Spark GO has crackling noise under large volume

Our goal in creating Spark GO was to deliver powerful and impressive sound quality while keeping the amp's size compact. In the event that the user experiences crackling noise from the speaker with a specific preset or setup, we recommend that they try lowering either the output volume or the low end of the preset.
