# Why Does the Spark LINK use 2.4GHz Wireless Technology?

Spark LINK employs reliable 2.4GHz wireless technology. Note, this is not the same as “2G,” which is commonly associated with cellular network generations. You might wonder why we chose 2.4GHz over 5GHz – isn’t higher better? The decision to use 2.4GHz over 5GHz was made after a thorough evaluation of several factors, including wireless reliability, transmission distance, latency, power consumption, cost, and adherence to global wireless regulations and compliance standards. While 5GHz technology can offer higher speeds, it also presents limitations such as shorter range and greater susceptibility to interference, which could impact the performance and reliability of your Spark LINK.Our goal in choosing 2.4GHz was to ensure the Spark LINK meets the high standards of performance, reliability, and global compatibility our customers expect. This strategic decision positions the Spark LINK as a superior choice for musicians and audio professionals worldwide.
