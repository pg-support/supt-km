# Spark sounds too bassy and muffled
> Spark sounds too bassy and muffled, lacks treble/high-end.

Spark's small speakers result in a narrow angle of projection. However, to compensate for this, we have intentionally amplified the bass response of Spark to create a bigger and louder sound. 

To enhance the listening experience, we recommend adjusting the projection angle of Spark, preferably by pointing it directly at the user while playing. Placing Spark on an elevated surface, like a table, can also eliminate any unwanted bass rumble. 

Moreover, with the release of Spark app v2.0.0, the user can use the Guitar EQ/Bass EQ effects to further customize the guitar/bass sound according to their preferences. Be sure not to miss out on this feature.
