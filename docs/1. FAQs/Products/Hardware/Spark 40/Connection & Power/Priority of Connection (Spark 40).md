### Internal Information

When the Spark 40 is connected to the computer via a USB cable, it functions as an audio interface. This means users can't adjust the volume in the system mixer, as the system only recognizes 1 (on) and 0 (off), ignoring any adjustments made with the fader. Instead of adjusting the volume on the computer, advise them to adjust the volume using the physical knob on the Spark 40.
