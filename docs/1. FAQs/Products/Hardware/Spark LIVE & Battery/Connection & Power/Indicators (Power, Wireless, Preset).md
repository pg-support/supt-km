# Indicators (Power, Wireless, Preset)
#### **Power Indicator**

Normally, the power indicator light on Spark LIVE is not illuminated when the power cable is plugged.

The power indicator turns red when Spark LIVE is powered on.

With Spark Battery loaded and power connected, the indicator stays green when Spark LIVE is powered on/off, breathes when Spark Battery is charging, and turns solid green when fully charged.
