# Power Indicator

Normally, the power indicator light on Spark LIVE is not illuminated when it's connected to the power.

The power indicator turns red when Spark LIVE is powered on.

With Spark Battery loaded and power connected, the indicator stays green when Spark LIVE is powered on/off, breathes when Spark Battery is charging, and turns solid green when fully charged.
