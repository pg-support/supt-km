# Can I save the edited parameters in the Mixer View to the hardware?

No, while you can adjust the faders to control the knobs on the Spark LIVE, it's not possible to save the parameters to the hardware. The parameters in Mixer View are configured based on the current positions of the knobs on the Spark LIVE when the Spark app is connected to the Spark LIVE.
