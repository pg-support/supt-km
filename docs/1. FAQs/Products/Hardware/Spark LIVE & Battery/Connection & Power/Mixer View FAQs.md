# Mixer View FAQs

# 1. Why aren't the faders on the Mixer View synced with the knobs when adjusting them?

The parameters in Mixer View are configured based on the current positions of the knobs on the Spark LIVE when the Spark app is connected to the Spark LIVE. Therefore, the fader in the Spark app does not synchronize with the physical knobs on the Spark LIVE at the moment. Users will need to close the Mixer View and reopen it to see the adjustment made on the Spark LIVE. 

# 2. Can I save the edited parameters in the Mixer View to the hardware?

No, while you can adjust the faders to control the knobs on the Spark LIVE, it's not possible to save the parameters to the hardware.
