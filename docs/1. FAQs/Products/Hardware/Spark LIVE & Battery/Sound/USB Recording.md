# USB Recording

- When Spark LIVE is used as an audio interface via the USB cable, it will be recognized as a 2-in/2-out device.
  
- No matter which input you select, **all physical input channels** will record through the same input. (Think of it like a mixer, in a way).

- ~~It is recommended that input volumes be manually balanced with physical controls before recording.~~
