# Load-Bearing Capacity of Spark LIVE

---
#### Internal Information

我這邊的建議是我們不能主動告知可以承重多少，主要是責任歸屬會100%變成我們，我會建議告知客戶我們是有測試過100公斤損壞，但是**基本上不建議拿來乘坐**，所以我們也有標示警語，我們無法確認他會拿來怎麼個坐法，美國人很多奇耙的官司

My suggestion is that we should not proactively state the weight capacity, as this would place 100% of the liability on us. Instead, I recommend **_informing the customer that we have tested up to 100 kg without damage. However, we do not recommend using it for sitting, which is why we have included a warning label._** We cannot guarantee how the customer will use it for sitting, and there are many unusual lawsuits in the U.S.
