### Internal Information
This guideline applies to all Positive Grid products with installed lithium-ion batteries:

Spark MINI
A charging cycle is 500 times: after 500 "full charge and discharge" cycles, the battery can still maintain 80% capacity. A full charge and discharge cycle means charging the battery to full capacity, using it until it's fully drained, and then charging it to full capacity again. This counts as one complete charge and discharge cycle.
