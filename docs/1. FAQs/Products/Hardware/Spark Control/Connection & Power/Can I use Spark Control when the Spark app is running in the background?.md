# Can I use Spark Control when the Spark app is running in the background?

No, to control the Spark amp with the Spark Control, the Spark app needs to be running in the foreground.

---
### Internal Note

Does it work with split-screen mode or multi-window mode?

### iOS
To be verified.

### Android
Spark Control may function with the Spark amp through the Spark app when the app is in split-screen mode or multi-window mode on Android (tested on Samsung S23+ with Android 14).

This functionality is not officially supported, so there is no guarantee of its performance.
