# Is connection with Spark App necessary to use Spark Control
Yes, your Spark amp **must** be connected with Spark app in order to use Spark Control, since Spark Control connects to the app instead of the amp.

If the app is disconnected from the amp, Spark Control will also be disconnected until the next time Spark app is reconnected with the amp.
