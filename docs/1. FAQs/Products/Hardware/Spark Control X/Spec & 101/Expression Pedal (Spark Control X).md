# Expression Pedal (Spark Control X)

The Spark Control X, designed as a versatile controller for guitarists, provides users with the convenience of two TRS input ports dedicated to expression pedals, allowing manipulation of channel volume, wah, and more.

*Expression pedal not included.


When the expression pedal is connected to the Spark Control X, the default parameter it controls is the Volume.

### Spark 40/MINI/GO

Expression 1 -> Control the Volume knob for Guitar Input 


~~Expression 2 -> Control Music knob~~
~~Note: This feature is not included in the first release for Spark 40 & MINI. Additionally, Spark GO does not have a music knob, so Expression 2 is not applicable.~~~~


### Spark LIVE

Expression 1 -> Control the Volume knob for Ch. 1 

Expression 2 -> Control the Music knob


### How to set up the Expression Pedal with Spark LIVE and Spark Control X? 

We recommend balancing all input channels and setting the **Master knob** to an appropriate maximum volume to prevent excessively loud volumes that could potentially blow the roof when the expression pedal is at 100%.
