# Change Scenario  & Assign Functions

> **Important: Spark Control X currently doesn’t have this feature when it’s directly connected to the Spark LIVE. The feature is expected to be released in July 2024.


1. Once you’ve connected the Spark Amp and Spark Control X within the Spark app, go to the Tone Page, and tap the icon on the left side of the ToneCloud icon to access the foot switch Menu.

2. Tap on the label below to customize the functionality of the corresponding foot switch.  
   *A command can only be assigned to one switch at a time. For example, "Tuner On/Off" can't be assigned to switch I & II at the same time.
