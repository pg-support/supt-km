# What's different between Spark Control X & Spark Control?

Spark Control X comes with 6 steel footswitches instead of Spark Controlâ€™s 4 footswitches.

Also, Spark Control X works as a standalone foot controller for the Spark LIVE amplifier and adds multi-color LEDs for on/off status indication and 2 expression pedal inputs.

Finally, Spark Control X comes with 3 transparent overlays that can be used to label functions assigned to the footswitches and can be swapped easily.
