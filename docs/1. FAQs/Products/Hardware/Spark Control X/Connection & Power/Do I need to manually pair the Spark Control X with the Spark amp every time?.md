# Do I need to manually pair the Spark Control X with the Spark amp every time?

For Spark LIVE, the users need to manually pair the Spark LIVE to Spark Control X every time.

For Gen 1 products, Spark Control X will automatically connect to Spark 40/MINI/GO when the amps are connected to the Spark app. 
(It takes a while because Spark Control X needs time to load the scenario from the Spark app.)
