# How to connect Spark amp to Spark Control X?

### Spark 40/MINI/GO

As with the Spark Control, the Spark app is necessary when using the Spark 40/MINI/GO with the Spark Control X.

1. Make sure that the Spark 40/MINI/GO is connected to the Spark app via Tone Control. 
   
2. Tap the "+ Spark Control X" button under the product card in the Spark app.
   
3. When Spark Control X is connected to the Spark app successfully, the app indicator on it will remain red.

When the Spark Control X is connected to the Spark 40/MINI/GO, all adjustments made on both the hardware and software will synchronize with the Spark Control X.


### Spark LIVE

Spark LIVE can connect directly to the Spark Control X directly without the Spark app.

1. Make sure both Spark LIVE and Spark Control X are powered on.
   
2. Press the pair button on the rear panel of the Spark LIVE, and it will begin searching the nearby Spark Control X.
   
3. When the connection is successful, the amp indicator on Spark Control X will remain red.


When the Spark Control X is connected to the Spark LIVE, all adjustments made on both the hardware and software will synchronize with the Spark Control X.


Note: Since the Spark Control X does not communicate with the Spark app, even if it is successfully connected to the Spark LIVE, the "+ Spark Control" button will still be displayed under the product card. 
If the customer taps the button, a pop-up window will appear, showing the pairing tutorial.
