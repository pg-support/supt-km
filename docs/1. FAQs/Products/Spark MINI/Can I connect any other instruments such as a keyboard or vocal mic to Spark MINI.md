# Can I connect any other instruments such as a keyboard or vocal mic to Spark MINI
Although Spark MINI is designed for guitar, you could use it with keyboards and a microphone with the proper adapter into the same guitar input.

Please note that the Aux In at the back panel of Spark MINI is NOT suitable for instruments and is recommended for music playback only.
