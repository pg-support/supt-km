# Can I use DC out on the rear of Spark CAB to charge the pedal

**No**, you can NOT use the DC out port on the rear of Spark CAB as a power source for your effect pedal(s). This DC out port is purpose-built exclusively for Spark 40.

It's important to note that the standard power voltage for most effect pedals is 9V.


**⚠ WARNING⚠**

Attempting to use this power source with other pedals could lead to a power mismatch, potentially causing damage to both the Spark CAB and any connected pedals.
