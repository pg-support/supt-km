# Does the internal speaker of Spark amp mute when connected to Spark CAB?

Yes, when you plug Spark Amp into Spark CAB, it will mute the internal speakers in the amp.

This is by design, as the connection is made through Spark amp's headphone output, and when this output is in use, the internal speaker automatically mutes.
