# What is an FRFR speaker?

An FRFR speaker, which stands for "Full-Range, Flat-Response" speaker, is purposefully crafted to faithfully replicate audio signals without adding any coloration/tonal alterations.

This type of speaker finds frequent application in professional audio settings, studio monitoring, and in conjunction with digital amp modelers. Its primary objective is to uphold the complete audible spectrum, allowing for accurate sound reproduction that preserves all the intricacies and subtleties of the original audio source. This is achieved by preventing any influence from the inherent characteristics of the speaker itself.
