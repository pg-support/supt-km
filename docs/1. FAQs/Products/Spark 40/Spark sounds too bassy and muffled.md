# Spark sounds too bassy and muffled
> Spark sounds too bassy and muffled, lacks treble/high-end.

As Spark has relatively small speakers, it means the angle of projection is quite narrow. We have purposely accentuated the bass response of Spark to make it sound like its bigger, louder counterparts.  
We'd suggest you adjust the projection angle of the spark and see if it makes any improvement, preferably pointing Spark directly at you while playing. We'd also suggest putting Spark on an elevated plain, preferably on a table, if you'd like to remove the bass rumble.  
  
Additionally, since the release of Spark app v2.0.0, you may use the Guitar EQ/Bass EQ effects to further tweak the guitar/bass sound to your liking. So definitely don't miss out on that.
