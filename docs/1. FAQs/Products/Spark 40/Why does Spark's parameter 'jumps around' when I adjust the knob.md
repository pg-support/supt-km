# Why does Spark's parameter 'jumps around' when I adjust the knob
> When I load a preset then adjust the knob on Spark amp, the parameter will have a huge jump and change the tone drastically.

Whenever you want to modify a preset, the "jumping" is unavoidable. In an ideal world, the knobs are automated and whenever you load a preset, they move to the right place like motorized faders on a modern mixing console. However, currently it's not something we're able to implement in the Spark amp.
