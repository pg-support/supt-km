# What charger or adaptor should I use with Spark Control
> Is Spark Control powered by a built-in battery? What charger/adaptor should I use?

Yes, Spark Control comes with a built-in battery. 

For charging, we recommend using the supplied cable with aÂ charging brick (not included)that features a USB port and supports at least 500mA charging. Charging via computer is not recommended.

Alternatively, any 9V center-negative power supply used for powering most guitar pedals can also be used to charge Spark Control.
