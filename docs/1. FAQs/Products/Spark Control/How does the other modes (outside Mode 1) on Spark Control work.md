# How does the other modes (outside Mode 1) on Spark Control work
> How do I utilize Spark Control's other modes (mode 2~7)

For the Mode button, you can hold the button to switch the mode (judge by the blinking of the red LED, i.e. enter Mode 1 by holding the button until it blinks once; enter Mode 2 by holding the button until it blinks twice).

Please note that **Mode 1 is the only mode thatâ€™ll work with Spark app**. If you exits Mode 1 when connected to Spark app, our app will instruct you how to get back to Mode 1.

The other modes (as seen on other AirTurn products) can support additional functionality. However, P**ositive Grid is NOT responsible for supporting the other modes that are outside the usage of Spark.** For usages outside of Spark amp (Mode 2~7), please refer to [AirTurn's support site](https://www.airturn.com/support) for further instruction.
