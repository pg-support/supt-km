# Why is the charger not included for Spark Control
By not having a charger, weâ€™re able to reduce the size of the box, thus making the packaging process more efficient. 

Common smartphone charging bricks should be compatible with Spark Control. Alternatively, you can use a 9V center-negative power supply (commonly used for guitar pedals) for charging as well.
