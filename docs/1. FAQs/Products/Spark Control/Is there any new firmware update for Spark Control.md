# Is there any new firmware update for Spark Control
> Do I need to update Spark Control's firmware?

Spark Control is shipped with the firmware that'll work perfectly with Spark amp, so no firmware update is required.

However if you'd like to check for further updates, please download the app ‘AirTurn Manager’ from App Store/Google Play and connect your Spark Control to check.
