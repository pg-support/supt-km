# Collaboration with Output
We have teamed up with Output to share our mailing list for promotional purposes.  

The way that it works is that Output will send an email to their mailing list about signing up for BIAS FX 2 free trial, and likewise we will send an email to our email database for Output Arcade free trial.

[You can find the email template here.](<[https://cdn.us1.exponea.com/positive-grid-dev/e/CgxgjmQwdQrrxjuihw8xlExpNEwI2UFyDGQhMNHk2guvZY2IPA.JW2y7GXTaTaZtg](https://cdn.us1.exponea.com/positive-grid-dev/e/CgxgjmQwdQrrxjuihw8xlExpNEwI2UFyDGQhMNHk2guvZY2IPA.JW2y7GXTaTaZtg)>) 

Once the Output users received their email, it will redirect them to the [sign up page](https://www.positivegrid.com/pages/output). The sign up period will run until the end of April, and the free trial period will run until the end of July, to make sure even if you sign up on the last day, you will still be able to enjoy the full 90 days free trial.

However, if you sign up earlier, the free trial period will also end at the end of July, meaning if you sign up earlier, you will be able to enjoy the free trial for more than 90 days. This information CANNOT be shared with the customer.

Once the sign up process is complete, the customers will receive [an email](https://cdn.us1.exponea.com/positive-grid-dev/e/CgxgjmQwdQrrxjuihw8xW5og2qII2UFyDGQii2gT5knigeQ-jA.kqayrdj_0tGkZQ) in about a minute. The email will contain a redeem code for BIAS FX 2 Elite and also a detailed instruction on how to redeem the license.

On the other hand, if our customers have any questions about how to sign up for Arcade, we will just simply redirect them to Output support.
