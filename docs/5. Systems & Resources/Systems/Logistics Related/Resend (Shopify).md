All the Resend requests should be done on Shopify now.

## Resend Instructions:


- For Resend request, inquire with the customer if they have an alternative address where the package can be successfully received. If the carrier fail to deliver the package again (RS fail), proceed with issuing a refund and kindly guide the customer to our authorized retailers, e.g. Guitar Center, Amazon.

-   Ensure that you select the correct item(s) that need to be resent. If the entire order needs to be resent, please select all the main products and accessories accordingly. 

- Once the RS order is created, provide the order number to the customer and inform them that they will receive the tracking information when the package is shipped.
