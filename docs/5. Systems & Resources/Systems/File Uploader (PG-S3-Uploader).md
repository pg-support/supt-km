## Upload a file
Drag and drop the file into the chat window and send it. Please upload only one file per message.

To keep the list organized, please name the file properly before sending it to the bot. For example, name the firmware update with log for Spark GO as follows: sparkgo_firmware_updater_with_log_macos_1.14.0.203

Note: Files with the same name can be uploaded and the old one in S3 will be replaced by the new one. Meaning, if you want to update one file, you donâ€™t need to delete it first then upload it again. Just upload it.


## List the uploaded files
Type 'list' to the uploader and it will list all the files uploaded before.
