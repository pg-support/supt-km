- [SKULabs](https://app.skulabs.com/) is our inventory management system for all kinds of order shipment and should be the first stop for checking any shipment status.

### Awaiting fulfillment
Product is in stock and address is valid. Awaiting shipment.
  
### Shipped

→ If TRK# is not available in SKULabs after 2 days staying in “Awaiting Fulfillment”, escalate via [[Daily Catch-up]].

### Opened
Product is in stock but address is invalid. Check [Shipping Info Missing Follow-up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JGEB4lF3NW7xdm78EnAu3EREmbbfI07jiRqdN3u9QWw/edit?usp=sharing) for further details and inquire correct information.

### Delayed
Product can be out of stock, address could also be invalid. Check [Fulfillment Schedule & Availability](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13mK6KP4YmWGT_NyAHVbmFVl5Wj5khDcB1fvpsDKTL24/edit?usp=sharing) to see if the item is out of stock.

If other items in the order are in stock, we’ll split the order for multiple shipments. SKULabs will show accordingly.

If there are items in the order that are in stock, but the order is still not shipped. Please check with the customer on the address and update accordingly if needed (see [[Shipping Info Missing]]).
