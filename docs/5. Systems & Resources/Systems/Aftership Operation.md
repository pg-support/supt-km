## Creating a Return

- Put in the customer's order number and the corresponding email (same on the order).

- Once submitted, the system will automatically redirect and take you to the page to choose the product you'll be returning.

- Once selected the correct item for return, select the correct reason for returning.
![[Pasted image 20230424121256.png]]

- In the 'Let us know more details', put in the additional information we collected from the users. For example, the answers to the following 3 questions:
>   
> A). Frequency of use for your product (example: 2hrs per day / 4 times per week)
> 
> B). Defective Frequency (if applicable) (example: issue occurs every 30mins of use)
> 
> C). How long after purchase did the product show the first sign of defect (example: 1 week into using the amp)

- Submit the return request, then select which next step we'll be taking after the item is returned: Replacement or Refund.

- If you select 'Replace with the same item', make sure to select the item that you'll be replacing with. 
  
  (Currently, this function has no affect and is for record only, as we still need to submit a request for replacement via the PG Supt-Logistics Form. Refer to [[Resend & Replacement]] for further details.)
  
  (If there is no stock available for the replacement item, you can select a different color as a workaround in order to proceed creating the return label.)

- Once confirm all the details for the return, hit 'Submit'.
![[Screen Shot 2023-04-24 at 3.08.32 PM.png]]

- Once submitted, you'll find this confirmation page with an internal RMA number. (The internal RMA number isn't too crucial, as we'll often still use the PG order number for searching.)

## Getting the Return Label

- Once a return is created, go back to the 'Return' section in Aftership (you might need to refresh the webpage), and you should find the latest return you just created.
![[Screen Shot 2023-04-24 at 3.21.55 PM.png]]

- Enter the detail page of the return, and hit 'Approve'.
![[Pasted image 20230424152350.png]]

- Hit 'Edit shipping info' in the pop-up window, if 'Submit' is greyed out.
![[Pasted image 20230424152610.png]]

- Go to the 'Carrier & package' section. First make sure 'Package' is selected as '**Custom**'. Then, make sure the dimensions and weight of the package are fill in according to the sheet below for your returned item.
  
  (If there're multiple items selected, simply fill in the dimension of the **largest item** that's being returned.)

![[Pasted image 20230424174239.png]]

- Once saved, hit 'Generate label'. 
![[Pasted image 20230424174513.png]]

***Note: If there's a $0 item in the order, it'll prevent us from generating a label. Please change the 'Unit price' for the $0 item to $1, in order to proceed.***

![[Pasted image 20230503171022.png]]

- Once the label is generated, check the 'Send email notification to customer' option, then hit 'Submit'. This will send out the return label to the customer, with instruction on how to ship the package.
  
  Once you've done that, simply ask the customer to check their inbox for the return label.

- If you ever need to retrieve the label for any specific order, just search for the order number in the 'Return' section in Aftership, find the RMA case, then find the 'View label' option under 'Shipment'. There you can find the label and manually attach it to your support ticket if necessary.
