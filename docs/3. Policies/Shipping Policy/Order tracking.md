# Order tracking
-   Inform the customers that they're able to check the order's tracking status in ‘My Orders’ section in the user center.

-   Also let them know that they will receive tracking information via shipping confirmation once the order has been shipped.

-   If the carrier is DHL in the EU, please follow the instructions to get an accurate tracking information:

  -    If the tracking status remains pending for 2 weeks (from the day that the package is shipped out), that's possibility that the package may eventually be lost. Report it to logistics team ([[Daily Catch-Up (JIRA)]]) then:

  1. Request a resend: [[Replacement, Resend (JIRA)]]
	Keep following up on the original tracking number. If it's delivered successfully, follow the [[SR - Delivery Error (US)]]  or [[SR - Delivery Error (Non-US)]] processes.
	
  1. Issue a refund: 
     Claim form needed. [[Shipment Lost]]
     
	Remember to inform logistics team that you've requested a RS or issued a refund on the JIRA ticket.
