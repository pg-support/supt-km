# Order tracking
-   Inform the customers that they're able to check the order's tracking status in ‘My Orders’ section in the user center.

-   Also let them know that they will receive tracking information via shipping confirmation once the order has been shipped.

- If the carrier is DHL in the EU, please follow the instructions to get an accurate tracking information:

  - If the tracking status is pending for 2 weeks, it's possible that the package may eventually be lost.
