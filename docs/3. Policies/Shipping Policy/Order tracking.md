# Order tracking
-   Inform the customers that they're able to check the order's tracking status in ‘My Orders’ section in the user center.

-   Also let them know that they will receive tracking information via shipping confirmation once the order has been shipped.

- If the carrier is DHL in the EU, please follow the instructions to get an accurate tracking information:

  - If the tracking status is pending for 2 weeks, it's possible that the package may eventually be lost. Report it to logistics team ([[Daily Catch-Up (JIRA)]]) and request a resend by creating a RS order on Shopify ([[Resend (Shopify)]]).

	Don't forget to inform logistics team that you've requested a RS on the JIRA ticket.

   *Keep following up on the original tracking number. If it's delivered successfully, follow the [[SR - Delivery Error (US)]]  or [[SR - Delivery Error (Non-US)]] processes.*
