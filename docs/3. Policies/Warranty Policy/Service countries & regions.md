# Service countries & regions
- We only offer warranty services to the countries/regions we ship the product to, see [[Countries we ship to]].  
- For countries in Asia that we used to sell directly, we still have to offer service for the products we sold to customers. 
- For Japan, we no longer have a local service center and should refer customers to MI Japan for all warranty services. Refer to the [[Countries we don’t ship (JP & Asia)]] for the official response for these inquiries, including the contact info of MI Japan. 
- For customers from other regions that are outside of our service area, please refer to [[Service for Non-Service Area]].
