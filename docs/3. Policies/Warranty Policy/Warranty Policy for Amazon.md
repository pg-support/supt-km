# Warranty Policy for Amazon

When the customer purchase our product from Amazon, there are 2 types scenarios - FBA & FBM.

### FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon)

Amazon is responsible for the shipment of the product, not PG. 

You can verify if an order is FBA by checking for a 'FBA' tag in SKULabs ([[SKULabs Operation]]). **For such orders, you will not see the TRK# in SKULabs, since it's fulfilled by Amazon, not our warehouse.**

Regarding the warranty, please verify if the user is in our [[Service countries & regions]] (which is the same as [[Countries we ship to]]). 

- If the user is in our service regions, and the order is within 30 days since delivery, ask the user to contact Amazon for DOA (replacement).

- If the user is in our service regions, and the order is outside 30 days since delivery, proceed with regular [[RMA (Non-US)]].

- If the user is outside our service regions, ask the user to contact Amazon for DOA/RMA.


### FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant)

PG is responsible for the shipment of the product (from our warehouse), not Amazon. 

If you don't see the 'FBA' tag in SKULabs ([[SKULabs Operation]]), instead you see the tag for the warehouse (like shown below), **you should also be able to find the TRK# for the order in SKULabs, as it's fulfilled by our warehouse.**
