# Delivery-induced Damage; Wrong & Missing Items
> SOP to help customers who receive delivery-induced damaged packages/products or wrong/missing items


1. Please first ask the customer to identify if the damage to the package/product was induced by the shipping carrier, i.e. if there’s damage to the package and even causing further damage to the product itself. 
   
   If the product damage was not induced by the carrier but is a manufacturing defect, proceed as DOA instead.
   
2. Once verified, please ask the customer to provide the following information:
   
   A. Damaged Package
		a. Clear photos of the whole package including the damaged part
		b. Clear close-ups of the damaged part
		c. Clear photos of the shipping label on the package
		
	>If the unit is damaged during transport and returned to sender, please proceed with Scenario 3 in the [[Shipment Lost]] SOP.
		
	B. Wrong/Missing Items
		a. Clear photos of all received packages
		b. Clear photos of all shipping labels for the received items
		c. Clear photos of all unboxed items
		
>	Also ask the customer to thoroughly look into the box

3. **[Upload the requested photos to this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19T-1sa_fnAY8LXlOu6sbkeM4w7_m_sdF?usp=sharing)**, and make sure the file name is formatted as “Carrier#OrderNumber - IssueType” (e.g., FedEx#429914 - Damaged, GLS#592293 - Wrong Item, UPS#122939 - Missing Item).
   
4. Once uploaded, proceed with the following:

	A. Damaged package: DOA process (return & replacement)
	
	B. Wrong items: SR process (Delivery Error, return & resend)
	
	C. Missing items: resend request (RS or Service Parts request, depending on the missing item)
	
5. Once the case is settled, report to the logistics team via Daily Catch-up form by submitting a support request (in Supt-Logistics form) accordingly. Once the case is reported, the ticket can be closed.
