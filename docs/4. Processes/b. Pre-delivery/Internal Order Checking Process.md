1. Check Support-pedia -> 7) Trending -> Fulfillment schedule for all products and verify if the customer’s order is in stock or in backlog, and communicate with the customer accordingly.  
2. If product is in-stock, check SKULabs first for shipping status.  
3. If the order shows ‘Opened’ or ‘Delayed’ on SKULabs, verify the address with the customer if necessary and update accordingly.  
4. If the order shows ‘ Not started’ and is indeed canceled due to fraudulent risk, ask the customer to reorder and possibly try another payment method.
