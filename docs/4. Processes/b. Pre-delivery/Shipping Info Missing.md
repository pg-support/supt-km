# Shipping Info Missing
1. Orders that are missing certain information in their addresses, will be shown as “Opened” in shipping status (in SKULabs), and also listed in the [Shipping Info Missing Follow-up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JGEB4lF3NW7xdm78EnAu3EREmbbfI07jiRqdN3u9QWw/edit?usp=sharing), each with its rejected reason.  
2. Agent needs to ask the customer to provide the renewed information according to the rejected reason. For example, we do not ship to military addresses, so please ask for a new address for such orders.  
3. Once sent/updated (new address updated in Shopify), fill in the form accordingly.  
4. Our logistics team will follow up to the form and ship out the updated orders.
