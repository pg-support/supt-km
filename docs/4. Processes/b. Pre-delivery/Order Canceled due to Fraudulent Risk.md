Orders with high fraudulent risk will be automatically stopped from shipping and refunded afterwards.  
  
For such orders, please verify if the shipment status is 'Not Started' in SKULabs, and shows high fraudulent risk in Shopify.  
  
If customers inquire about their canceled orders, please let them know that their orders were not fulfilled due to unsuccessful payment, and ask them to reorder, possibly with a different payment method.
