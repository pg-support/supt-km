> (If the destination for the package matches the above, it’s returned to the shipper.)
> 
>  If the package is returned, please ask for clarification on the address, then proceed with the following isntructions:


1. Ask the customer to provide a new address to avoid the same thing from happening again.
2. Once a new address is provided, fill in the Supt-Logistics Request Form for resend.
	1. ‘Hardware Product’, ‘1st Accessory’... should be selected according to what needs to be re-sent. If the whole order needs to be re-sent, select all the main products and accessories accordingly.
	2. ‘RS/RE Reason’ should be “Returned to shipper, please resend.”
	3. **If the address for resend is different from the original, update it in Shopify and also fill in all the shipping info accordingly in the request form.**
3. Inform the customer that we’ll arrange another shipment, ask them to wait for further notice. Submit the ticket as ‘On-hold’.
4. **Please follow up to the ticket and make sure to provide the tracking information to the customer when the new shipment is out for delivery, before closing the ticket.**
