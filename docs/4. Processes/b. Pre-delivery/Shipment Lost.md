1.  **Critical Importance**: Check the tracking first and identify the scenario carefully with the following steps:  

##### Scenario 1: Original address is wrong

> Check with the customer whether the original address is correct. (Attach a screenshot from Shopify to get confirmation on the address.) 
> 
> If the original address is indeed wrong (provided by the customer) and the customer still requesting a resend, highlight as special case.
  

##### Scenario 2: Returned to shipper

> If the tracking information shows ‘Delivered’, check if it’s been returned to the shipper instead. It will show something like this on the tracking page:

> 
> If the customer requests to re-sent the package, proceed by submitting a resend request.


##### Scenario 4: Shipment Lost

> If
> 1.  the tracking shows delivered (and wasn’t returned to the shipper) but the customer claims otherwise (and the address is correct), and/or
> 2.  the tracking status shows it's signed but the customer claims to not know the person who signed it,
