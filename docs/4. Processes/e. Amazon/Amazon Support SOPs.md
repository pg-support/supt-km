# Amazon Support SOPs
> This guide covers a range of issues that may arise with Amazon orders and provides instructions on how to handle them.

## Verify the Amazon Order
> **Prior to handling the ticket, it is essential to verify whether an Amazon order is FBA or FBM.**

There are 2 types of Amazon orders: FBA & FBM.

### FBA
FBA stands for "**Fulfillment by Amazon**," which is a service provided by Amazon where sellers store their products in Amazon's fulfillment centers, and Amazon takes care of the picking, packing, shipping, and customer service. 

For any fulfillment issues for FBA orders (e.g. returns, wrong item shipped, tracking inquiries, etc.), **ask customers to directly contact official Amazon Support, as the order is fulfilled by Amazon.**

### FBM
FBM stands for "**Fulfillment by Merchant**," which means the seller is responsible for storing, picking, packing, shipping, and handling customer service for their products.

**If customers have any issues regarding FBM orders, we at PG Support should be responsible for such cases.**

### How to verify
- To distinguish between FBA and FBM orders, click on the menu button at the top-left corner in Amazon Seller Central.

- Check the "Fulfillment" section in the 'Order Summary' under 'Order Details'. **The 'Fulfillment' section will display 'Amazon' for FBA orders, and 'Seller' for FBM orders.**

- **For shipping-related inquiries, we only need to handle the FBM orders (which is fulfilled by Positive Grid). On the other hand, we should redirect customers with FBA orders to Amazon Support for shipping-related inquiries.**

## Order Return
### Within 30 days - Amazon's Return Process
Within 30 days of purchase, we should always ask customers to return their unit (no matter the reason) via Amazon's system. This will leave a return record on Amazon and would be easier for tracking.

However if the customer is particularly irate about the situation and wants PG to offer a pre-paid return label, please highlight to Tagui for further discussion.

#### Returning a product via Amazon

Within 30 days of purchase, a customer can return the product by simply 
1. Going to Amazon's website
2. Finding the refund option under their order
3. Choosing a return method and printing the label
4. Shipping it back to us 

- If a customer asks about the return process, advise them to follow the Amazon return process.
  
- These Amazon's return requests will be automatically approved by the system.

- **Customer may notify us after they have shipped the product(s), and we'll proceed with the [[#Order Refund]] process.** If the customer didn't notify us, they may wait for the system's automatic refund (which will take longer).

- If a customer claims to have not received a refund after proceeding with the Amazon return process, **ask for the carrier and tracking number, and check if it is in transit**. **Once confirmed the item is on its way back (no need to wait for delivery), we may proceed with the [[#Order Refund]] process.**


Below are some common reasons and additional steps for Amazon order return:

#### Personal Reason
- Customers want to return the product due to personal reason. Proceed with the above mentioned process.

#### Cosmetic damages
- Ask customers for photos of the damages, as suggested in [[Delivery-induced Damage]] SOP.
  
- Once the photos are uploaded, ask the customer to follow the official Amazon return process to return the product. 
  
- Once it's returned, proceed with either sending a replacement (by requesting a replacement as suggested in [[Resend & Replacement]]), or [[#Order Refund]].
  
- We may offer a $5~10 partial refund for customer satisfaction, on a case-by-case basis. Please discuss with Tagui on this matter.

#### Technical issues
- **For technical issues / troubleshooting, it's best to advise customers to contact our official support team for further assistance.

- However, if a customer insists on returning the product due to technical issues, ask them to proceed with the official return process. 

- Ask the customer to notify us after they ship the product(s). Once the product is on the road, we may proceed with either sending a replacement ([[Resend & Replacement]]) or [[#Order Refund]].

#### Customer-induced damages
- Ask the customer to proceed with the official return process.

- Ask the customer to notify us after they ship the product(s). Once the product is on the road, we may proceed with [[#Order Refund]].


### Over 30 days
There's no guaranteed return after 30 days. Ask the customer to contact our official support team for further assistance.


### (Reference Only) Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee Refund
- A-to-Z refund is a policy offered by Amazon for buyers' protection.

- **It guarantees that customers can receive a refund or replacement for their purchase if they have not received their order or if the item is not as described, defective, or damaged.**

- Customers can file an A-to-Z Guarantee claim on the Amazon website, and Amazon will investigate the claim and take action to resolve the issue. If a claim is found to be valid, Amazon will issue a refund to the buyer, and the seller's account may be subject to penalties or suspension.

**-> We should avoid having customers filing A-to-Z claims at all cost, by attending to the customers diligently.**
**-> A-to-Z Guarantee claim is currently handled by Christine of the logistics team.**


---
## Price Matching
- For orders not yet placed, advise the customers 'make the purchase that best suit their needs'. **(It's against Amazon's policy to suggest customers go to somewhere else for purchase.)**

- For orders already placed, we only accept **price matching for offers from the same platform within a week**. Price-matching with other platforms (such as PG website) is NOT possible. 
  
  For Amazon offers price-matching, ask the customer to provide a screenshot of the offer within a week (that is also on Amazon). Once verified, we may offer partial refund.

---
## Repair Service
If the customer want to request for repair service, ask them to contact our official support team for further assistance.

---
## Change Address
Amazon's system does NOT support changing the address of an order. If the situations calls for it (special case), please fill in [[Daily Catch-up]] to request changing the address at the warehouse side.

---
## Swap / Add / Deduct Items in an Order
Amazon's system does NOT support altering the items in an order. Proceed with [[#Order Cancellation]] process for such inquiries.
