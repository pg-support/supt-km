# Amazon Support SOPs
> This guide covers a range of issues that may arise with Amazon orders and provides instructions on how to handle them.

## Verify the Amazon Order
> **Prior to handling the ticket, it is essential to verify whether an Amazon order is FBA or FBM.**

There are 2 types of Amazon orders: FBA & FBM.

### FBA
FBA stands for "**Fulfillment by Amazon**," which is a service provided by Amazon where sellers store their products in Amazon's fulfillment centers, and Amazon takes care of the picking, packing, shipping, and customer service. 

For any fulfillment issues for FBA orders (e.g. returns, wrong item shipped, tracking inquiries, etc.), **customers should contact Amazon Support (that 's NOT PG Support) directly as the order is fulfilled by Amazon.**

### FBM
FBM stands for "**Fulfillment by Merchant**," which means the seller is responsible for storing, picking, packing, shipping, and handling customer service for their products.

**If customers have any issues regarding FBM orders, we at PG Support should be responsible for such cases.**

### How to verify
- To distinguish between FBA and FBM orders, click on the menu button at the top-left corner in Amazon Seller Central.

- Check the "Fulfillment" section in the 'Order Summary' under 'Order Details'. **The 'Fulfillment' section will display 'Amazon' for FBA orders, and 'Seller' for FBM orders.**

- **For shipping-related inquiries, we only need to handle the FBM orders (which is fulfilled by Positive Grid). On the other hand, we should redirect customers with FBA orders to Amazon Support for shipping-related inquiries.**

## Order Return
### Amazon's Official Return Process
Within 30 days of purchase, a customer can return the product by simply 
1. Going to Amazon's website
2. Finding the refund option under their order
3. Choosing a return method and printing the label
4. Shipping it back to us 

- If a customer asks about the return process, advise them to follow the [Amazon return process (link to Amazon's help center)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G6E3B2E8QPHQ88KF&ref_=hp_help_c_Return-Items-You-Ordered). 

- **Customer may notify us after they have shipped the product(s), and we'll proceed with the [[#Order Refund]] process.** If the customer didn't notify us, they may wait for the system's automatic refund (which will take longer).

- If a customer claims to have not received a refund after proceeding with the Amazon return process, ask for the carrier and tracking number, and check if it is in transit. **Once confirmed the item is on its way back (no need to wait for delivery), we may proceed with the [[#Order Refund]] process.**

### Non-official Return Process
Within 30 days of purchase, a customer might request to return the product (not via the official Amazon channel) for the following reasons:

#### Cosmetic damages
- Ask customers for photos and assist with returns, exchanges, or special case resolution. Same process as [[Delivery-induced Damage]].

- We may offer a $5~10 partial refund for customer satisfaction, on a case-by-case basis. Please discuss with Tagui on this matter.

#### Technical issues
- **It's best to advise customers to submit support tickets on the official PG website for troubleshooting.** (template?)

- If they insist on returning the product, submit a return request with pre-paid return label (same process as [[DOA]] or [[SR - Fail to Intercept]], depending on whether the product is defective). 

- Ask the customer to notify us after they ship the product(s). Once the product is on the road, we may proceed with [[#Order Refund]].

#### Customer-induced damages / personal reasons
- Same process as [[SR - Personal Reason]]. 

- Ask the customer to notify us after they ship the product(s). Once the product is on the road, we may proceed with [[#Order Refund]].


### Over 30 days
There's no guaranteed return after 30 days. Redirect the customer to PG Supt for further assistance. (Template??)


### (Reference Only) Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee Refund
- A-to-Z refund is a policy offered by Amazon for buyers' protection.

- **It guarantees that customers can receive a refund or replacement for their purchase if they have not received their order or if the item is not as described, defective, or damaged.**

- Customers can file an A-to-Z Guarantee claim on the Amazon website, and Amazon will investigate the claim and take action to resolve the issue. If a claim is found to be valid, Amazon will issue a refund to the buyer, and the seller's account may be subject to penalties or suspension.

**-> We should avoid having customers filing A-to-Z claims at all cost.**
**-> A-to-Z Guarantee claim is currently handled by Christine in the logistics team.**

## Return Label?????
-   For Amazon US orders, use Amazon's provided return label.
-   For Amazon EU orders, you can apply for the company's pre-paid return label.
-   Form: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5GIKG13O87EsoMWnhCpnZyUxLOqDISNz81wRifBN53Fp7Xw/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5GIKG13O87EsoMWnhCpnZyUxLOqDISNz81wRifBN53Fp7Xw/viewform)
-   Contact Felix Lin for inquiries about return labels.

---
## Return/Refund???

-   Items can be returned/refunded within 30 days. Customers should provide the tracking number for the return.
-   For US orders, go to Amazon Seller Central > Order > Return Order to check the return progress.
-   For EU and other sites, check the logistics website for confirmation of the return and then contact Christine for a refund.
-   For orders older than 30 days, customers can contact customer service on the official website for assistance.

---
## Price Matching
- For orders not yet placed, advise the customers 'make the purchase that best suit their needs'. **(It's against Amazon's policy to suggest customers go to somewhere else for purchase.)**

- For orders already placed, we only accept **price matching for offers from the same platform within a week**. Price-matching with other platforms (such as PG website) is NOT possible. 
  
  For Amazon offers price-matching, ask the customer to provide a screenshot of the offer within a week (that is also on Amazon). Once verified, we may offer partial refund.

---
## Repair Service
If the customer want to request for repair service, ask them to submit a request form on the official website. (Email Template??)
