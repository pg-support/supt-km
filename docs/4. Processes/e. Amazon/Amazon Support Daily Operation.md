# Amazon Support Daily Operation
> This guide provides the essential information for agents to process Amazon orders. 

## Daily Operation
- Login to BQool to check the support tickets and order feedbacks daily. 
- Login to Amazon Seller Central to check the support tickets (for regions not covered by BQool) and complete order info.

## Important Notes
- **Do NOT mention things like 'website', 'link', or provide any links to the customer in Amazon's support channel. This might violates the terms of Amazon and cause us great trouble.**

- If we need to redirect customers from Amazon to PG Supt, simply tell them "**Please contact our official support team for further assistance.**" and nothing more. Do NOT give them any link.

- **We do NOT ask customers who bought from Amazon to sign claim forms.**

## BQool
### What is BQool

- BQool is a software system designed for Amazon sellers to help them manage their business on Amazon. 

- **BQool currently only supports Amazon marketplaces in the US, Canada, Mexico, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain**. 

- For customer service emails related to other Amazon marketplaces, we need to use **Amazon Seller Central** instead.

#### Ticket Status in BQool
Please ensure that you **update the ticket status in BQool using the same process as in Zendesk**. Use the following definitions to help you select the appropriate status:

-   New: This status indicates that the ticket has been newly submitted by the customer, and no action has been taken on it yet. The action/response should come from the agent.
    
-   Open: If the ticket has been assigned and is waiting for action by the agent, set its status to Open. The action/response should come from the agent.
    
-   Pending: When the agent is waiting for a response or further information from the customer, set the status of the ticket to Pending. The action/response should come from the customer.
    
-   On-hold: If the agent is waiting for information or action from the corresponding stakeholder (not customer), set the status of the ticket to On-hold. The action/response should come from the stakeholder.
    
-   Solved: There are three situations that fall under this status:
    
    1.  The agent has submitted a known/verified solution to the problem/inquiry, and no further response is required from the customer.
    2.  The customer has approved of the resolution or confirmed that the case can be closed.
    3.  There has been no further response from the customer after 7 days. No action/response is required from anyone at this point.

#### Ticket Respond Time Limit
It is important that agents responsible for Amazon tickets **respond to new or open tickets within 24 hours**. 

Agents should monitor the '**Time Left**' metric in BQool closely to ensure that they respond to the tickets in a timely manner.

#### Q&As in BQool
There's a specific 'Q&A' type of inquiries that'll show up in BQool. (See photo below.)

- We'll click on 'Answer this question' to answer it. The question and answer will show up on our Amazon's product page. 

- Some users might inquire about their orders or other personal matters in this public Q&A. Make sure to avoid giving out too much information (since it's public), and redirect them back to the normal service channel instead.

- We only have one chance to answer these questions, and the answers will be public. Please make sure the answer is correct and proper before submitting.

### Order Feedback
- Check daily to see if there's any negative feedback review in BQool.

- If any, go back to Amazon Seller Central > Performance to check and respond accordingly. (TBC in [[#Amazon Feedback]])
