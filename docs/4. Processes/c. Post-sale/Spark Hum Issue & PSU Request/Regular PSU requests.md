1.  Macro Spark “Hum 1”, submit as pending.
	1. The power brick on a grounded power supply should look like the photo on the left. If the customer’s PSU looks like the one on the right, proceed with step 2.

	2. If the customer has a grounded power supply (left), please inform them about it, as grounding should not be an issue for them. If they still have persistent hum noise, the unit could be faulty. Proceed with proper troubleshooting.

2.  Use macro “Hum 2” to inquire about the customer’s current contact information and product SN#. 

3.  Once the customer submits the address, compare it with the corresponding Shopify/BigCommerce order information and make sure the addresses are matched. 
   
> *If they don’t match, double check with the customer. Once the customer confirms the info to be correct or provides updated info, proceed with the next step.

4.  Fill out the [Supt-Logistics Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd0Hei0HZSqwf_bzUTIdutMvE_a_N2VGuOc5fta-jwun69PA/viewform?fbzx=4036418607483484801) (Service Type: [[Service Parts Request]]) and make sure to fill in full contact information (submitted by the customer during “Hum 2” macro) in the form.  
   
>  *PSU requests within warranty do not need invoices.*

5.  Once submitted, check back at the [PG Supt-Logistics Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fy29NhrA1tZJXq3LkVxNPUamxsd1ddPnmv3llIYY2E4/edit?usp=sharing) (Service Part Request). Since 1 amp can only be paired with 1 GPSU, if your GPSU request is marked as green, it means we’ve already sent a GPSU for the same amp, thus this new GPSU needs to be charged and another request needs to be submitted.

6.  After filling out the request form, please use the macro “Hum 3,” submit as ‘On-hold’ and wait for the tracking number.
   
7. PSU will be shipped within roughly 2 days. Check back for TRK# and provide it to the customer. (END)
