# Regular PSU requests
> In the initial release of Spark 40, the power supply units (PSU) we offered were ungrounded. Many customers thus encountered humming noise in their Spark amp. Since then, we’ve been offering grounded PSUs for customers who bought the amp that comes with ungrounded PSU.
> 
> Grounded PSU has been added to the manufacturing of Spark amp since 2020, thus these days most newly-bought Spark amps should have the grounded PSU included. We must verify if the customer’s issue really is related to ungrounded PSU, or otherwise.


0. To verify the PSU, use Macro <u>Spark Hum 1</u>, submit as pending. A grounded power supply should look like the photo on the left. Only proceed with the rest of this process if the customer's PSU is verified to be ungrounded (right).

1. If the customer has a grounded power supply (left) instead, please inform them about it, as grounding should not be an issue for them. If they still have persistent hum noise, the unit could be faulty. Proceed with proper troubleshooting.
2. Use macro <u>Hum 2</u> to inquire about the customer’s current contact information and product SN#. 
3. Once the customer submits the address, compare it with the corresponding Shopify/BigCommerce order information and make sure the addresses are matched. If they don’t match, double check with the customer. 
4. Once the customer confirms the info to be correct or provides updated info, proceed with the next step.
