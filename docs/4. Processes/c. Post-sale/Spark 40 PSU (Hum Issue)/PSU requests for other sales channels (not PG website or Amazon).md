# PSU requests for other sales channels (not PG website or Amazon)
- Customers must provide a valid purchase receipt for the unit, on which we can find relevant information for the dealer/vendor. If a receipt is provided, we can proceed as a [[Regular PSU requests]] (put the last 6 digits of Spark SN# in ‘Order Number’).

- If the customer can not provide the receipt, then we’ll consider it as a second-hand unit and proceed as a Service Part Request.
  
- Depends on the region, see [[Service part request (US)]] or [[Service part request (Non-US)]] (put the last 6 digits of Spark SN# in ‘Order Number’).
