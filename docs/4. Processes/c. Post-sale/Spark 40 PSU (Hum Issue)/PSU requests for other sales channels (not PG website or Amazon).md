# PSU requests for other sales channels (not PG website or Amazon)
- Customers must provide a valid purchase receipt for the unit, on which we can find relevant information for the dealer/vendor. If a receipt is provided, we can proceed as a [[Regular PSU requests]] (put the last 6 digits of Spark SN# in ‘Order Number’).

- If a receipt cannot be provided, we’ll consider it as a second-hand unit and proceed as a [[Service part purchase request]] (put the last 6 digits of Spark SN# in ‘Order Number’).
