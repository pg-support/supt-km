# PSU requests for second-hand unit
- As long as the customer can provide the original order number from Positive Grid, we will view it as the original order and can proceed as a [[Regular PSU requests]] (as long as GPSU has not been requested for the said order).

- If the customer can not provide the original order number, then we’ll consider it as a second-hand unit and proceed as a Service Part Request.
  
- Depends on the region, see [[Service part request (US)]] or [[Service part request (Non-US)]] (put the last 6 digits of Spark SN# in ‘Order Number’).
