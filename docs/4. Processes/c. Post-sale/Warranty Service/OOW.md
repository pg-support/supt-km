### 0 - Verify the warranty
Before proceeding, please check the user's name & email and compare them with Shopify order information in order to verify the warranty.

If the customer bought from another dealer, the agent must ask for the receipt in order to verify the warranty (if it’s already over 1 year of the purchase). Once verified, proceed with the OOW process. 

If the customer bought the amp second hand, ask the customer for the purchase date.


### 1 - Inform about the charge upfront
Once confirmed the issue, please first check with the customer whether he/she is willing to pay for the replacement/repair upfront, pricing listed as below:
   
<u>Spark 40 / Spark Pearl </u>

>    **The pricing for Spark 40 here does NOT apply to the US, as the US service center (who can repair Spark 40) will directly contact the customer for the repair charge.**

-   Check-up - $50 USD
-   Main product - $60 USD
-   Handle Strap - $30 USD (Proceed as a [[Service Parts Request]], resend the item to the customer who paid for it)    

<u>Spark MINI</u>
-   All defects (Charge for replacement) - $120 USD

<u>Spark Control</u>
-   Main product (Charge for replacement) - $77 USD 

<u>RIFF</u>
-   Main product (Charge for replacement) - $70 USD
-   Lightning to microUSB cable - TBD
-   USB-A to microUSB cable - TBD


### 2 - Inquire information for payment
Once confirmed the customer is willing to proceed and pay for the repair/replacement, insert Macro: <u>[Service Center] OOW - 1</u>.

Insert the correct country in the email subject. Submit as ‘Pending’.

> <u>Important note for [Spark 40 OOW cases in CA, AU, UK]</u>: Make sure to request the replacement as B-stock, which will be our certified like-new products. (For other products, proceed with regular replacements.)
> 
> Communicate with the following message: “In order to provide faster resolution, we'll offer a certified like-new replacement for you.”
> 
> <u>Important note for [Spark 40 OOW cases in US]</u>: Such cases should be repaired, and no need to ask for a PayPal account in such cases. Please communicate with the customer accordingly as suggested in the Zendesk macro.
> 
> (To be continued in Step 7)


### 3 - Fill out a OOW request
Once the client replied with all the requested information, fill in the [PG RMA Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5GIKG13O87EsoMWnhCpnZyUxLOqDISNz81wRifBN53Fp7Xw/viewform):

1. ‘Service Type’ = CID/OOW.
2. ‘PayPal Account’ = Customer’s PayPal account, or regular contact email. (No need for US - OOW - Spark 40.) 
3. ‘Invoice Amount’ depends on what part is defective / needs to be swapped out (see step 1), so fill in accordingly.
4. ‘Warranty Service’ should be ‘Repair’ for service centers that can perform repairs; ‘Replacement’ for those who can’t & Spark Control & RIFF.
5. ‘Defective-User Scenario’ should be obtained via OOW Macro. Find the example below.
6. Fill in all address details accordingly.

> *If the unit is purchased via another dealer, put the dealer’s name in ‘Order Number’.
> *If the unit is a second hand purchase, put the purchase date in ‘Order Number’.
