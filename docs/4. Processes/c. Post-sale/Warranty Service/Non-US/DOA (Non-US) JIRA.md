### 3 - Ticket created, awaiting return label
Once the ticket is created, our RMA specialist will tag the agent and attach the **return label** to the ticket. Agents can monitor the case status on the [RMA board](https://positivegrid.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/RMA/boards/63).
   
Reply the ticket with a heads-up, for example:
   
> Thanks for providing the information. 
> 
> I will keep you posted for the call tag/shipping label to return your package. Please wait for further notice. Thank you.

### 4 - Offer return label
Service center should send the return label directly to the agent’s inbox within 3 days. ‘Inbound Tracking Number’ and ‘Current Status’ should both be updated accordingly.

> *If no label shows up within 3 days, please reach out to Anya Lien.
   
Once received the return label, use macro <u>Return Label</u> and forward all related information & return labels (attached to the email) to the client.

Make sure to provide the correct RMA number (auto-generated when submitted). Submit as ‘Pending’.

### 5 - Check the TRK# for the returned package
Check the tracking with the corresponding carrier and verify whether the case will need a replacement or refund.

#### Replacement
If the case requires a replacement, it can be requested as soon as the package is on the road. 

Request a replacement by submitting a ticket on JIRA ([[Replacement (JIRA)]]).
   
Logistics team should send out the replacement within roughly 2 days. The shipping information will be available in SKULabs.
   
Forward the tracking information to the customer when available. Case can be closed. (END)


#### Refund
If the case requires a refund, we need to wait for the package to be received by our service center. Once we can see the package is on the road, communicate with the customer as below:

> We can see that your package is on its way back to our service center. Please be advised that once our service center has received and verified the package, we'll offer the refund for you ASAP.
> 
> Kindly wait for further notice. Thank you.

If an ETA is available on the tracking site (of the carrier), you may note it in the ticket in order to check back.

On the ETA of the returning package, check the [RMA Form](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fYeg8mAWoIm7QqNo04HF5kmb49IqBUpa?usp=sharing) to verify if the service center has received it. 

Once the package is confirmed to be received, proceed with the [[Refund Process]]. (END)
