# RMA (Non-US)
> For all RMA cases at this time, please proceed by sending a replacement.

### 0 - Verify the warranty
Before proceeding, please check the user's name & email and compare them with Shopify order information in order to verify the warranty.  

> If the customer bought from another dealer, the agent must ask for the receipt in order to verify the warranty (if it’s still within 1-year of the purchase/2-year in the EU). Once verified, proceed with the RMA process. 

### 1 - Inquire about basic info
Once confirmed the issue, insert Macro: <u>[Service Center] RMA</u>. Insert the correct country in the email subject. Submit as ‘Pending’.
