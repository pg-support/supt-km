### 0 - Verify the warranty
Before proceeding, please check the user's name & email and compare them with Shopify order information in order to verify the warranty.

If the customer bought from another dealer, the agent must ask for the receipt in order to verify the warranty (if it’s already over 1 year of the purchase). Once verified, proceed with the OOW process. 

If the customer bought the amp second hand, ask the customer for the purchase date.


### 1 - Inform about the charge upfront
Once confirmed the issue, please first check with the customer whether he/she is willing to pay for the replacement/repair upfront, pricing listed as below:
   
- Spark 40: $80
- Spark MINI: $60
- Spark GO: $40
- Spark Control: $40
- RIFF: $40

### 2 - Inquire information for payment
Once confirmed the customer is willing to proceed and pay for the repair/replacement, insert Macro: <u>[Service Center] OOW - 1</u>.

Insert the correct country in the email subject. Submit as ‘Pending’.

### 6 - Confirm payment & offer info for return

The agent should ask the customer to check their inbox for the invoice and inform us once it's paid off. Tag Vix / Maines / WeiTing on Supt-Private Channel to confirm the payment status.

Vix will also check the payment status once a day.

Once the invoice is confirmed to be paid off, ‘Invoice Status’ will be updated to 'To Do' Section in the ticket on JIRA.
