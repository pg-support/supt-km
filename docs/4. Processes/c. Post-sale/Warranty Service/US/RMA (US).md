# RMA (US)
> For all RMA cases at this time, please proceed by sending a replacement.

> Note that this process only applies to Shopify order. If you're processing an order from BigCommerce, please follow [[RMA (Non-US)]] instead.

### 0 - Verify the warranty
Before proceeding, please check the user's name & email and compare them with Shopify order information in order to verify the warranty.  

> If the customer bought from another dealer, the agent must ask for the receipt in order to verify the warranty (if it’s still within 1 year of the purchase). Once verified, proceed with the RMA process. 

### 1 - Inquire about basic info
