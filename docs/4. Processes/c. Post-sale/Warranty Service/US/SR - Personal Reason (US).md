Reply the ticket with a heads-up, and submit as ‘On-hold’:

> Thanks for providing the information. 
> 
> We've informed our service center to look out for the incoming package and will keep you updated about the refund as soon as possible. 
> 
> Please wait for further notice. Thank you.

### 5 - Check the status of the received package
On the ETA of the returning package, check the tracking with the corresponding carrier to verify if the returned item is delivered. 

- Once delivered, the agent can proceed with the [[Refund Process]].

- **Since a $15 shipping fee needs to be subtracted from the final refund, make sure to manually put in the refund amount.**

- If an additional $20 restocking fee needs to be deducted from the refund, make sure to do so.

- If there's shipping fee in the order, make sure NOT to refund it for such cases (personal reason).
