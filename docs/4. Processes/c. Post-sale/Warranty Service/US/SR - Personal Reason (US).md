# SR - Personal Reason (US)

> **SR (Sales Return)**
> Personal Reason - Return (Paid by the customer) & Refund
> 
> The SR process only applies to orders that still within 30 days of delivery.
> 
> We'll provide the return label to the customer then subtracted the $15 shipping fee from your final refund. This is explained in the SR macro.
> 
> If the customer no longer has the original packaging for return, a $20 (USD) restocking fee needs to be charged and will be deducted from the refund (see [Spark Warranty FAQ](https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060273211-Spark-Warranty-FAQ) for reference). Please explain this to the customer. (Applicable to ALL products.)

### 1 - Inquire about basic info
Once confirmed that the customer would like to return the order (must be a full order), insert Macro: <u>[Service Center] SR (Regular) - 1</u>. Insert the correct country in the email subject. Submit as pending.

Reply the ticket with a heads-up, and submit as ‘On-hold’:

> Thanks for providing the information. 
> 
> We've informed our service center to look out for the incoming package and will keep you updated about the refund as soon as possible. 
> 
> Please wait for further notice. Thank you.

### 5 - Check the status of the received package
On the ETA of the returning package, check the tracking with the corresponding carrier to verify if the returned item is delivered. 

- Once delivered, the agent can proceed with the [[Refund Process]].

- **Since a $15 shipping fee needs to be subtracted from the final refund, make sure to manually put in the refund amount.**

- If an additional $20 restocking fee needs to be deducted from the refund, make sure to do so.

- If there's shipping fee in the order, make sure NOT to refund it for such cases (personal reason).
