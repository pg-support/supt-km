# OOW (US - Spark 40 Repair)
> This SOP is for OOW - US - Spark 40 only.
> For everything else, please refer to [[OOW (Non-US)]]

### 0 - Verify the warranty
Before proceeding, please check the user's name & email and compare them with Shopify order information in order to verify the warranty.

If the customer bought from another dealer, the agent must ask for the receipt in order to verify the warranty (if it’s already over 1 year of the purchase). Once verified, proceed with the OOW process. 

If the customer bought the amp second hand, ask the customer for the purchase date.


### 1 - Inform about the paid repair
Once confirmed, insert Macro: <u>[Service Center] OOW (US Spark 40 Repair)</u>.

### 2 - Fill out a OOW request
Once the client confirmed they want to proceed with the repair and replied with all the requested information, fill in the [PG RMA Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5GIKG13O87EsoMWnhCpnZyUxLOqDISNz81wRifBN53Fp7Xw/viewform):
