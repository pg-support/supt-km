### 5 - Check the TRK# for the returned package
Check the tracking with the corresponding carrier and verify if the item is returned.

#### Replacement
If the case requires a replacement, it can be requested as soon as the package is on the road. 

Fill in [Supt-Logistics Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd0Hei0HZSqwf_bzUTIdutMvE_a_N2VGuOc5fta-jwun69PA/viewform?fbzx=4036418607483484801) to request a replacement. 
   
Logistics team should send out the replacement within roughly 2 days. The shipping information will be available in SKULabs.
   
Forward the tracking information to the customer when available. Case can be closed. (END)


#### Refund
If the case requires a refund, we need to wait for the package to be received by our service center. Once we can see the package is on the road, communicate with the customer as below:

> We can see that your package is on its way back to our service center. Please be advised that once our service center has received and verified the package, we'll offer the refund for you ASAP.
> 
> Kindly wait for further notice. Thank you.

If an ETA is available on the tracking site (of the carrier), you may note it in the ticket in order to check back.

On the ETA of the returning package, check on the carrier's site to verify if the item is delivered.

Once the package is delivered, proceed with the [[Refund Process]]. [END]
