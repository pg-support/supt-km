### 4 - Check the TRK# for the returned package
Check the tracking with the corresponding carrier. Once the package is on the road, contact the customer and mention the following:

> We can see that your package is on its way back to our service center. Please be advised that once our service center has received the package, we’ll issue the refund/resend the correct item ASAP. Please wait for further notice. Thank you.

### 5 - Check the status of the received package
On the ETA of the returning package, check the tracking with the corresponding carrier to verify if it's on the way to our service center. 

Once the package is on its way, verify whether the case is an operation error (we sent an extra item) or will require a resend (we sent a wrong item).

1. Operation Error (we sent an extra item): Thank the customer for cooperation and close the ticket, no further action needed. (END)
   
2. Resend (we sent a wrong item):  Fill out a RS or Service Part request on [[Resend & Replacement (JIRA)]] depending on the item missing. Offer the TRK# to the customer once available. (END)
