> Before proceeding, please check the user's name & email and compare them with Shopify order information in order to verify the warranty. 

### 1 - Inquire about basic info
Once confirmed the issue, insert Macro: <u>[Service Center] DOA</u>. Insert the correct country in the email subject. Submit as pending. (If the customer does not want replacement but refund instead, please modify the macro accordingly.)

### 2 - Fill out a DOA request
Once the client replies with all the requested information, fill in the [PG RMA Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5GIKG13O87EsoMWnhCpnZyUxLOqDISNz81wRifBN53Fp7Xw/viewform):

1.  ‘Service Type’ = DOA.
2.  ‘Warranty Service’ should normally be ‘Replacement’ unless the customer specifically asks for a refund. 
3.  ‘Defective-User Scenario’ should be obtained via DOA Macro. Find the example below. (No need to fill in if the issue is related to cosmetics.) 
4.  Fill in all address details accordingly.

### 3 - Request submitted, awaiting return label
Once submitted, the service center will send the return label to the agent’s email. Agents can monitor the case status via each service center/region’s [RMA Form](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fYeg8mAWoIm7QqNo04HF5kmb49IqBUpa?usp=sharing) (DOA tab).
   
Reply the ticket with a heads-up, for example:
   
> Thanks for providing the information. 
> 
> I will keep you posted for the call tag/shipping label to return your package. Please wait for further notice. Thank you.

### 4 - Offer return label
Service center should send the return label directly to the agent’s inbox within 3 days. ‘Inbound Tracking Number’ and ‘Current Status’ should both be updated accordingly.

### 5 - Check for the returning package 
Check the tracking with the corresponding carrier. Once the package is on the road, contact the customer and mention the following:

> We can see that your package is on its way back to our service center. Please be advised that once our service center has received and verified the package, I’ll request the replacement/refund to be sent out for you ASAP.
> 
> Please wait for further notice. Thank you.

If an ETA is available on the tracking site (of the carrier), you may note it in the ticket in order to check back.

### 6 - Check the received package
On the ETA of the returning package, check the [RMA Form](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fYeg8mAWoIm7QqNo04HF5kmb49IqBUpa?usp=sharing) to verify if the service center has received it.

   - If ‘Case Status’ is updated to ‘Missing Items’, it means there’re missing item(s) according to the form. Service center will address what’s missing in ‘Warehouse Notes’. Agent shall contact the customer to further verify the missing item before proceeding.

   - If ‘Case Status’ is updated to ‘Ready for Refund/Replacement’, the agent can proceed with the next step.

### 7 - Offer refund / replacement
- For refund cases, escalate the ticket to Maines with a change to subject (add <u>[Refund]</u>) and a proper internal note. (END)
