*If the customer is out of the service region, please reach out to Anya Lien directly.

1. Ask if the customer's willing to pay for the price. If so, get the PayPay account email or regular email from the customer. (We don't need to collect the defective unit due to high shipping fee.)
   
2. Once we have the info, tag WeiTing or Maines to create an invoice and send it to the customer.
   
3. Ask the customer to pay off the invoice. Once done, ask for the shipping address (in EU or UK), and inform Anya Lien to send out the new BIAS Head/Rack/MINI/Pedal.

4. Offer the TRK# to the customer when available.
