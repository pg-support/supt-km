# Refund Process
- Make sure the order is within 30 days since purchase, unless it's a special case.

- There are two ways to refund an order. Itâ€™s easier to refund via Zendesk. However, if you don't find the correct order to refund in Zendesk, then head to the Shopify website for the action. 

### Refund in Zendesk

1). To refund via Zendesk, navigate to the right column in your Zendesk ticket and find the Shopify plugin.

2). There are six Shopify plugins for each region we sell. Identify the correct Shopify plugin for the region where the customer is located. For example, if it is a US customer, open the Shopify plugin for the US.

3). The Shopify plugin should search for the customer's order records based on the ticket requester's email.

4). If the email used to contact us is different from the email used to purchase the order, Shopify will not be able to find the order record. In such cases, you will need to process the refund via the Shopify system instead.

5). Once you have located the order in the Shopify plugin, click on "View order" to verify that it is the correct order that the customer is requesting a refund for, and also check whether the order is eligible for a refund.

6). If the order is eligible for a refund, click on "Refund order."

7). A refund process window will pop up. Select the correct item(s) for refund, deselect the "Restock" option, and input the reason for the refund as stated in the ticket.
