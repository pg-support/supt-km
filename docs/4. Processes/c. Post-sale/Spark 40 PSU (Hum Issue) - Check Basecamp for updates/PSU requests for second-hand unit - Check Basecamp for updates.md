# PSU requests for second-hand unit- Check Basecamp for updates
- As long as the customer can provide the original order number from Positive Grid, we will view it as the original order and can proceed as a [[Regular PSU requests - Check Basecamp for updates]] (as long as GPSU has not been requested for the said order).

- If the customer can not provide the original order number, then we’ll consider it as a second-hand unit and proceed as a Service Part Request.
  
- Depends on the region, see [[Service part request (US) - Check Basecamp for updates]] or [[Service part request (Non-US) - Check Basecamp for updates]] (put the last 6 digits of Spark SN# in ‘Order Number’).
