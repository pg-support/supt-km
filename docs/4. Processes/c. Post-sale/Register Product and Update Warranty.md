There are two types of orders: one is purchased from Positive Grid's official website (Shopify), and the other is purchased from dealers or retailers (B2B). The purchase channel slightly affects the page display.

### Internal Information
Under normal circumstances, the registration process should include warranty verification.

However, Positive Grid's current goal is to collect as much information as possible. That's why we've decided to separate the "registration" and "warranty verification" processes to simplify registration.

So registering the product doesn't mean the warranty status is calculated. After registering, the customer needs to verify the warranty.
