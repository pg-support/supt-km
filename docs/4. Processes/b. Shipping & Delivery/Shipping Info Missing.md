# Shipping Info Missing

1. Orders that are missing certain information in their addresses, will be shown as “Opened” in shipping status (in SKULabs), and also listed in the [Shipping Info Missing Follow-up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JGEB4lF3NW7xdm78EnAu3EREmbbfI07jiRqdN3u9QWw/edit?usp=sharing), each with its rejected reason.  
   
2. Agent needs to ask the customer to provide the renewed information according to the rejected reason. For example, we do not ship to military addresses, so please ask for a new address for such orders. The addresses include P.O. boxes will also be rejected by the logistics team. 
   
***Always search the order number on Zendesk and check whether there is an existing ticket .
***

3. Once sent/updated (new address updated in Shopify), fill in the form accordingly.  
   
4. Logistics team will follow up on the form and ship out the updated orders.

5. Don't forget to close the ticket (update the status to **Order Shipped / Delivered / Resolved**). 



We only need to manage orders on Shopify and Amazon, please disregard any other orders.*

Amazon order: xxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx
