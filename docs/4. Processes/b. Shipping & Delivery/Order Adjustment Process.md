# Order Adjustment Process

> Since it's against our policy to add/deduct/swap items in an order once it's placed, please escalate to Tagui (or Joseph/Dans) for confirmation before adjusting the order.

1).  Log in to SKULabs, and navigate to the order management page.
    
2).  Find the order that includes the item that needs to be adjusted. Check the **shipment status** in SKULabs, which is located at the top left corner of the order details page.

3).  Determine whether the order is eligible for adjustment. The order can only be adjusted if it is in "not started," "opened," or "delayed" status. If the order is in "awaiting fulfillment" or "shipped" status, it cannot be further adjusted.

4).  If the order is eligible for adjustments, go to Shopify's system and find the same order (in the corresponding store for the region).
    
5).  On the order detail page, click "Edit" on the top-right corner.

6).  In the order edit page, click "Remove item" if you need to swap it out for something else (make sure to uncheck the 'Restock' option).

If you need to add something, search for the item to add in the search bar under "Add product" and select it to be added into the order.

7).  If the added/swapped item does not require any additional payment, make sure the final price is the same as before.

8).  If you need to add a free item to the order, click on "Apply discount" for the selected item and apply a 100% discount to make it free.

9).  Input the reason for the edit for record-keeping purposes.
    
10).  Once the final price is confirmed, click "Send invoice" and confirm to apply the changes.
