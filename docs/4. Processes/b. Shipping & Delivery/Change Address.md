# Change Address
> If a customer requests their order address to be changed, first verify if the order is still not shipped, shipped but not delivered, or already delivered.

## Case 1: Not yet shipped
1. Go to Supt-Logistics Form and fill in a Daily Catch-up -> Change Address request.
2. Fill in all required fields including the new shipping address, and submit the request.
3. Go Shopify and also update the shipping address on the order.
4. Make sure to review your request in Supt-Logistics Form (Responses) -> Daily Catch-up tab, to check if the logistics team has marked the address change as “done”. (END)


## Case 2: Shipped & not delivered
> Inform the customer that the order is shipped, and additional fee (USD $20 for all regions within the same country) is required for address update (we do not support changing addresses across different countries). 
> 
> Ask the customer to provide their PayPal account email (or regular email if they don’t have PayPal) if they’re willing to pay the fee. 
> 
> This could lead to 2 scenarios:

### Scenario A: Customer will pay the fee
1. Go to Supt-Logistics Form and fill in a Daily Catch-up -> Change Address request. Make sure to fill in the PayPal account. 

2. Maines should issue the PayPal invoice directly to the customer’s inbox/PayPal account, and change the Invoice Status (in Supt-Logistics Form (Responses)) to “Sent”.
3. Once the customer has paid off the fee, Invoice Status will be updated to “Paid”. 
4. Logistics team will then change the address and send out the order. TRK# should be available within 2 days since their update. 

### Scenario B: Customer wants to cancel 
- Proceed with [[Order Cancellation]].


## Case 3: Shipped & delivered
- If the package ends up delivered to the original/wrong address, we assume no further responsibility.
