# Order Cancellation Process
> If the order is delivered prior to the cancellation request, the order cannot be canceled and the customer must proceed with the regular sales return ([[SR - Personal Reason (Non-US)]]) process.

## Verify the shipment status

1). Log in to SKULabs and navigate to the order management page.

2). Find the order that needs to be cancelled and check its **shipment status**, which is located at the top left corner of the order details page.

3). Determine whether the order is eligible for cancellation. The order can only be cancelled if it is in 'not started', 'opened', or 'delayed' status. If the order is in 'awaiting fulfillment' or 'shipped' status, it cannot be cancelled and we'll need to ask the customer to refuse the shipment.

### Not started / Opened / Delayed
