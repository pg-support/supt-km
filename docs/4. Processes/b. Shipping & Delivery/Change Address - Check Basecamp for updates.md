# Change Address - Check Basecamp for updates
> Due to the high possibility that the package will be shipped during the change address process, we're not going to accept the address change request now. 

## Incorrect Shipping Address
If the package is returned to our warehouse (tracking# shows 'return to sender') due to an incorrect address provided by the customer during the order, a $20 shipping fee will be charged to the customer due to the resend process.

## Delivered
If the package ends up delivered to the original/wrong address, we assume no further responsibility. We kindly ask the customer track the package by themself.
