# Delivery-induced Damage
1. Ask the customer to identify if the damage to the package/product was truly induced by the shipping carrier, i.e. if there’s damage to the package and even causing further damage to the product itself. 
   
2. Once verified, please ask the customer to provide the following information:
	1. Clear photos of the whole package including the damaged part
	2. Clear close-ups of the damaged part
	3. Clear photos of the shipping label on the package
	
	(If the unit is damaged during transport and returned to sender, please proceed with Scenario 3 in the [[Shipment Lost]] SOP.)
	
3. **[Upload the requested photos to this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19T-1sa_fnAY8LXlOu6sbkeM4w7_m_sdF?usp=sharing)**, and make sure the file name is formatted as “Carrier#OrderNumber - IssueType” (e.g., FedEx#429914 - Damaged, GLS#592293 - Wrong Item, UPS#122939 - Missing Item).
   
4. Once uploaded, proceed with the [[DOA (Non-US)]] process (return & replacement)
   
5. Once the case is settled, report to the logistics team via [[Daily Catch-Up (JIRA)]] by submitting a ticket request in Logistics-Support (LS) accordingly. 
6. Once the case is reported, the ticket can be closed.
