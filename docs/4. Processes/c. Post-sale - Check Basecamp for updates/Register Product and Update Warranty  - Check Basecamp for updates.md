[Help Center - How Do I Register My Products?](https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/24992891565581-How-Do-I-Register-My-Products)

<br>

There are two types of orders: one is purchased from Positive Grid's official website (Shopify), and the other is purchased from dealers or retailers (B2B). The purchase channel slightly affects the page display.
<br>
## Register the product online
<br>
All the product can be registered on the [My Product](https://member.positivegrid.com/my-product/device) page.
<br>
#### Shopify Order:
The customer can register the product associated with their order.

When the website syncs with the delivery status from the 3PL (third-party logistics), products should automatically appear listed. However, the delivery status from the 3PL doesn't update on the website all the time. This means the delivery status shown online might not always be accurate.

See also: [Delivery status from 3PL (third-party logistics)](https://pg-support.github.io/supt-km/5.%20Systems%20%26%20Resources/Resources/Delivery%20status%20from%203PL%20%28third-party%20logistics%29/)

For example, if a customer receives their Spark 40 on Monday and wants to register it right away, they are not able to find that the product listed on 'My Product' page. This is because the 3PL status hasn't updated to show the delivery as complete yet.

In this case, the customer will click 'REGISTER NOW' on the empty 'My Product' page.

Another issue occurs if the 3PL status updates are synced with the website on Tuesday. This can result in the product being listed twice on the 'My Product' page, causing confusion for the customer.

### Internal Information
Under normal circumstances, the registration process should include warranty verification.

However, Positive Grid's current goal is to collect as much information as possible. That's why we've decided to separate the "registration" and "warranty verification" processes to simplify registration.

So registering the product doesn't mean the warranty status is calculated. After registering, the customer needs to verify the warranty.
