# Custom Grille Cancellation Process
## Design Not Yet Approved

If the design is not approved yet, proceed with regular [[Order Cancellation Process - Check Basecamp for updates]] process.


## Design Approved

If the design is already approved and 'Ready To Print' tag is added to the order on SKULabs, but the customer is requesting to cancel the order. Please verify the order status on SKULabs as instructed:

### Order shows 'Delayed'

We may remove the 'Ready to Print' tag, and proceed with the regular [[Order Cancellation Process - Check Basecamp for updates]] process.


### Order shows 'Awaiting Fulfillment'

As soon as the order shows 'Awaiting Fulfillment', it means the order is already sent to our partner (NMotion) for printing and shipping. Please go to the [Cancel Order Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QWlU9GCxHrK5SsvI39NrN39Xlavc271mEfhcQ6IJk6k/edit#gid=1621356637) to request our partner to cancel the order at their end.

If NMotion reported the cancellation is successful, we may proceed with the [[Refund Process]].

If NMotion reported the cancellation is not successful and the item is shipped, please communicate with the customer accordingly.
