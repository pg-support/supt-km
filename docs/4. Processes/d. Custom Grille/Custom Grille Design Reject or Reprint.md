# Custom Grille Design Reject/Reprint
> If the design violates our [Submission Guidelines](https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/9291263379341-Personalized-Product-Submission-Guidelines), or consists of system/design error, please follow through this process for rejecting/reprinting the order, based on whether it includes other products.

## Reject - Order only includes customized product(s)

> Before cancelling the order in SKULab, always go to Shopify and check the order. 
> 
> If the order is $0 and from a KOL/artist, which will have a different coupon code than the ones in [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1we-F-6i0Vch8DEKhzYNKKCP_bRx8EPp_VVGbgFXFa9I/edit?pli=1#gid=861761529), we do not want to cancel the order due to copyright material and should instead approve the design.

## Reprint - Order includes other product(s)

> If an order includes products besides the custom grille, the other products will be shipped separately by our logistics team as long as they're in stock. 
> 
> In such cases, we should prioritize asking the customer to proceed with the **reprint process**. 
> 
> However if the user would like to be refunded instead, we can offer partial refund for the customized item. Please proceed by removing the customized item from the order in Shopify and offer partial refund.

**IMPORTANT: Issue a partial refund for the shipping fee AFTER the package is shipped from NMotion. (temporary 23.10.19)**

Victor Huang will send the ticket with coupon code to the customer. Support Team needs to link the new and old order together by tagging the old order number onto the new one.

Go to Shopify and locate the new order, select "Orders" and type the old order number to the comment.
