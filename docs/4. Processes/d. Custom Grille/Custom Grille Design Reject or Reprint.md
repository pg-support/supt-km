# Custom Grille Design Reject/Reprint
> If the design violates our [Submission Guidelines](https://help.positivegrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/9291263379341-Personalized-Product-Submission-Guidelines), or consists of system/design error, please follow through this process for rejecting/reprinting the order, based on whether it includes other products.

## Reject - Order only includes customized product(s)

> Before cancelling the order in SKULab, always go to Shopify and check the order. 
> 
> If the order is $0 and from a KOL/artist, which will have a different coupon code than the ones in [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1we-F-6i0Vch8DEKhzYNKKCP_bRx8EPp_VVGbgFXFa9I/edit?pli=1#gid=861761529), we do not want to cancel the order due to copyright material and should instead approve the design.

a. Find the order in [Skulabs](https://app.skulabs.com/). 

b. Select Menu -> Cancel Order.

c. Ask Weiting/Maines to refund the order

d. Once the refund is issued, go back to [Order Record](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1we-F-6i0Vch8DEKhzYNKKCP_bRx8EPp_VVGbgFXFa9I/edit?pli=1#gid=366409741) and change the order status to 'Refund' and fill in 'Notes' and 'Category' accordingly.

e. Open a new ticket, put in the user's email, then use Zendesk macro [Custom Grille Declined Email] to send an outbound ticket to the customer. 

> If the design does NOT violate the submission guideline but instead has some design errors, please modify the macro accordingly. 

Make sure you put in the order number in the email subject.

f. Submit the email (as 'Solved'). [END]


## Reprint - Order includes other product(s)

> If an order includes products besides the custom grille, the other products will be shipped separately by our logistics team as long as they're in stock. 
> 
> Thus we cannot cancel and refund the order, and need to proceed with the **reprint process**.

**For reprint, we basically will offer a coupon code for the user to re-purchase and re-design the same customized item for free. 

**Once the new design/order is placed, we'll proceed to print and ship the new order. The old design/order can be left untouched.**

a. Based on the purchased customized product, offer a corresponding coupon code which'll cover the full price for a new order.

You can find the coupon code for each customized item listed in [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1we-F-6i0Vch8DEKhzYNKKCP_bRx8EPp_VVGbgFXFa9I/edit?pli=1#gid=861761529).

b. Ask the customer to provide the new order number once the purchase is completed. 

c. Review the order again ([[Custom Grille Review Process]]). Once approved, add the 'ReadyToPrint' so it'll be passed to our partner.

d. On the new order, add the original order number in the note section.

e. Go back to [Order Record](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1we-F-6i0Vch8DEKhzYNKKCP_bRx8EPp_VVGbgFXFa9I/edit?pli=1#gid=366409741), add all the info from the new order, and also put in the original order + (CGRP) (Custom Grille Re-Print) in the 'Note' column. [END]
